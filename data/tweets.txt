06/12/2013 15:08 now someone (I know exactly the person) is going to keep emailing everyone gifs and it's all my fault.
06/12/2013 15:05 I just spilled fake coffee on myself after helping to circulate a department-wide email thread full of gifs. karma. figures.
06/12/2013 01:27 bread for my house
05/12/2013 18:32 anyway, that happened at 6 this morning. I did eventually go back to sleep and had actual rest between 9 and 1.
05/12/2013 18:30 ...was trying to get to me. idk where I am, exactly. but I hear footsteps, door opening, and I have nowhere to go. I wake up.
05/12/2013 18:30 ...cornered in a bathroom stall. I hear loud footsteps and shouting in the hall. children performing a pageant were massacred b/c someone...
05/12/2013 18:29 ...to kill me. I use pathos to stop them, but everyone else is out to get me too. I have to run around and hide a whole lot until I get...
05/12/2013 18:29 Here's what happened: so I find out, somehow, that there's a million-dollar bounty on my head. a bunch of my friends from home are trying...
05/12/2013 18:27 Dream report: absolute action-adventure-thriller nightmare. hhhhohhhh my god. I never want to sleep again.
05/12/2013 03:58 @plaidplaidduck peel 1 panel of banana. scrape out some insides. fill with chocolate, pb, w/e, wrap in foil and roast over fire. eat w/spoon
05/12/2013 03:36 @plaidplaidduck I had the soda awhile ago, and also a caffeine pill. maybe I could make a banana boat and toast it on the stove.
05/12/2013 03:34 ...but Eric lost. :(
05/12/2013 03:33 This fighter on Salty Bet, "Eric," may actually be Eric Spoerl.
05/12/2013 03:16 I...I'm so done. I just don't feel like doing work anymore. Maybe if I take it easy tonight I can reset for tomorrow.
05/12/2013 01:29 @klaauser fuck teamwork
04/12/2013 21:29 totally passed tweet no. 6666 with no fanfare &gt;:(
04/12/2013 21:26 @klaauser ah yes good call
04/12/2013 20:05 I could...print them! or pipe them into a file! or something!
04/12/2013 20:05 :flops around wildly: I can retrieve my tweets using a python wrapper for the twitter API.
04/12/2013 18:10 ... or contribute to the project AT ALL
04/12/2013 18:10 REALLY annoyed by catty comments in the user testing from people in my HCI group. maybe you could show up to meetings once in a while ...
04/12/2013 18:02 @verticaltrout oh nooo umm I'm not home and I'm too far away/busy right now to go home. @theDickUpBear are you home?
04/12/2013 17:57 rosemary/olive oil potato chips + lemon soda :3
04/12/2013 16:36 @verticaltrout @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight generally someone is around starting at noon or so, if that works.
04/12/2013 14:56 "You seem to live in that lab!" I do, thanks for noticing, Bob Geitz. &gt;:D
04/12/2013 04:12 @verticaltrout @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight Tay should be there? If not I will be there in 30.
03/12/2013 23:01 @orashaboogie I don't wanna talk to strangers I'd rather come see you :D
03/12/2013 23:00 @orashaboogie I need to reinstall Mac OSX but I don't have an install disk. also I need to back up my stuff before I do that.
03/12/2013 22:36 @orashaboogie when do you work at the help desk? I need help.
03/12/2013 17:44 I just never end up giving presents on the appropriate holiday. they almost always get deferred to new year's.
03/12/2013 17:43 now I suddenly have a billion ideas of what to get everyone for New Year's.
03/12/2013 17:43 I just remembered Scoutmob exists (it's a little like etsy, but with a limited number of sellers + lots of quality control + focus on local)
03/12/2013 16:32 @jwisser np, your help was appreciated. :)
03/12/2013 16:31 @jwisser hmmmm...okay, thanks!
03/12/2013 16:30 @jwisser ah okay. nah, I'm fine with that stuff. it just seems like things could get messy.
03/12/2013 16:29 @jwisser starting over w/ubuntu instead of snow leopard
03/12/2013 16:28 @jwisser but that is better advice than what I was planning.
03/12/2013 16:28 @jwisser okay. it's just that time is of the essence and I don't have my install CD with me. :&lt;
03/12/2013 05:56 @jwisser SMART is "verified."
03/12/2013 05:47 maybe that explains why I feel p down.
03/12/2013 05:47 seasonal...depression?
03/12/2013 05:35 @jwisser a little over 4 years old. Snow Leopard. reformatted and installed Snow Leopard again 2 years ago. HD.
03/12/2013 05:32 getting an awful lot of kernel panics lately, not sure what to do really. (paging @jwisser)
03/12/2013 05:32 I realize it's "precise" pangolin but I think pedantic is better.
03/12/2013 05:31 would kind of rather be using Ubuntu 12 (Pedantic Pangolin) anyway
03/12/2013 05:31 great. I ultra-broke my computer. considering just wiping everything and starting from scratch b/c I don't have my Mac OSX disk with me.
03/12/2013 02:17 @verticaltrout okay cool! Well I am going to my lab and then 4meal pretty soon but @theDickUpBear should be home.
03/12/2013 02:04 @verticaltrout yeah we're in our house! knock on door. you'll have to park someone in b/c I don't think there's room for a 4th car next door
03/12/2013 01:19 now I'm sitting in bed and eating any combination of garlic parmesan pretzel chips, potato chips, and spicy hummus.
03/12/2013 01:07 well I curled up in bed with the intention of doing...something. I'm not sure what I was thinking. I'm definitely doing nothing.
03/12/2013 00:10 I finally did my dishes. :)
02/12/2013 23:07 @FleetingMadness you caught me. That one is my magnum opus.
02/12/2013 21:48 @verticaltrout I would be there but I am too broke to go out. Sorry! ;~;
02/12/2013 20:13 I am in No Mood for anything
02/12/2013 20:03 stop bothering me with emails about this party I'm not going to attend. you have one literally every month at least and I never go.
02/12/2013 18:52 lovingly-crafted to-do lists
02/12/2013 18:49 @yak_dad @JamieisPerf @nautilimeyer as a rule, I don't really give rides anymore. :\ let me know if you absolutely can't find anyone, though
02/12/2013 05:49 @blaiddxdrwg aaaaAAAAAA
02/12/2013 05:31 @jwisser I remember the terror that a BSOD instilled in me as a child. it is so cold and scary and urgent. it freaked me the fuck out.
02/12/2013 05:30 @jwisser that screen was so weird and scary! I did not like it.
02/12/2013 05:30 I feel like usually when there's a kernel panic it just shuts itself down and makes me deal with it.
02/12/2013 05:29 KERNEL PANIC?! that was really weird. my mac just straight-up told me to shut it down. it's never done that before.
02/12/2013 04:19 I'm short enough that people think I'm liftable. what if there's a ceiling fan?
02/12/2013 04:17 things I worry about: someone picking me up and lifting me into a ceiling fan.
01/12/2013 23:32 can I justifiably do nothing for the rest of the night? ... ... ... maybe and I will anyway.
01/12/2013 23:24 what do I get my parents for decemberween? paging @AlexWardy1
01/12/2013 22:20 @aDoctorMoon oh noooo I'm glad I didn't read the whole thing it just looked so horrible I had to stop
01/12/2013 21:08 my grade in HCI is miraculously still ~96%, higher than the average and the median. &gt;:D
01/12/2013 20:49 looks like touhou anyway
01/12/2013 20:49 I'm glad I didn't bet. what would I even do? I would have bet the one that can switch out, but she seems like she's not switching in time.
01/12/2013 20:48 d-double touhou on saltybet????
01/12/2013 20:09 it was just one of those things where I was like "you actually buy into this shit?...I...I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
01/12/2013 20:09 at least, I think it was. it was too difficult to get through so I skimmed it.
01/12/2013 20:08 wow. I just saw, like, the worst, most fat-negative article in ever. posted on fb by someone I know at Oberlin. really?!
01/12/2013 17:29 RT @ModCloth: Brunch bar. http://t.co/iYO6FYM15C #sundayfunday http://t.co/TkoCVrpzzS
30/11/2013 20:33 I should clean the house. Don't mind me, I am just prioritizing publicly.
30/11/2013 20:33 I might be drug-tested soon???
30/11/2013 20:31 Today I am not hungover. I think it's time for a sobriety week.
30/11/2013 20:31 I could take a bath?????
30/11/2013 20:30 It is now time to decompress.
29/11/2013 18:43 @TheBardofNight taymorrow afternoonish
29/11/2013 18:39 it's not really that bad, I'm exaggerating a little. but I do not feel so great.
29/11/2013 18:38 is this (crippling vertigo and dizziness accompanied by nausea) going to be for forever ??
29/11/2013 18:37 eternal hangover ???
29/11/2013 18:36 god bless everyone what a lovely thanksgiving
29/11/2013 18:34 @donnerhai &gt;:( yeah that's some bullshit. I'm sorry, bro.

27/11/2013 06:00 I want 1 day where I don't have to do anything. I hope that day is Thursday.
27/11/2013 05:55 @have_a_hammer ffffffffthat's what's in that bag?! augh!!
27/11/2013 00:18 @Tantoes_ no can do--I have a take-home exam due tomorrow. :(
26/11/2013 19:32 :rolls around unhappily:
26/11/2013 19:22 and I've had like 6,000 coffee
26/11/2013 19:22 why am I hungry I *just* ate lunch
26/11/2013 19:11 I think I have $500 to enable me to travel to San Francisco for my internship &gt;:D
26/11/2013 18:42 @TheBardofNight @locuscoeruleus the cutest
26/11/2013 17:12 Today everything is difficult. I even forgot a pen. :heavy sighing:
26/11/2013 17:10 Difficulties with lunch today.
26/11/2013 17:09 @locuscoeruleus *bobby boschy
26/11/2013 16:40 caffeine needs to start kicking in p soon that would be great
26/11/2013 16:40 unable to find "?" on a keyboard is about where I'm at today.
26/11/2013 05:52 this is A+ http://t.co/eisYDuh6nI
26/11/2013 05:23 2200 salt...the most salts I ever had...
26/11/2013 05:22 we lost 1500 salts in a few rounds this weekend... ;~;
26/11/2013 04:34 drinking in mourning and celebration.
25/11/2013 22:54 @spooky_quark I wish. I would not win tho
25/11/2013 22:16 wow. I just got another phone interview!
25/11/2013 21:52 Meg brought her cat to hci today and I gotta say that definitely made my day better. :)
25/11/2013 21:52 Watch fourteen 20-somethings try to keep their shit together when a cat comes to class.
25/11/2013 20:22 I pity whoever sits next to me in HCI today. probably Cynthia.
25/11/2013 20:22 I smell awful because I forgot to put on deodorant today. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 20:21 ...this account is private, right? O___O"""""
25/11/2013 20:20 they said they'd get back to me in 2-3 weeks. I guess that'll give me enough time to detox.
25/11/2013 20:19 but also during job interview: "of course we'd have to drug test/background check you" O__O"
25/11/2013 20:19 I have been joking that I am minus a cat but up $5000, so I can get as many new cats as I want. or one cat + vet bills.
25/11/2013 20:18 I just had a job interview, also! for an entry-level position that I might be getting into after my internship is over! today is not so bad.
25/11/2013 19:59 ":raises eyebrow: Mozilla, huh?" YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.
25/11/2013 19:32 @TheBardofNight yeah! Seems good.
25/11/2013 19:26 @TheBardofNight yes, yes I do.
25/11/2013 19:05 :rolls on the floor: I got it I gOT THE INTERNSHIP I GOT IT OMG
25/11/2013 18:37 @vomeronasal sure, feel free to bring him by my lab anytime before 3 (if you have time), if not we could meet for coffee later or w/e works
25/11/2013 18:22 @donnerhai not saying you're wrong or anything, just something to consider.
25/11/2013 18:22 @donnerhai sure but it's anyone's own business what their level of treatment is. you can choose for yourself until legality becomes an issue
25/11/2013 18:03 rant over, I promise. time to get back to work.
25/11/2013 18:03 and making people like me out to be wholly subservient to big pharma is not cool at all.
25/11/2013 18:02 I'm not saying that it's not okay to be off meds. it's excellent if you can do that, it probably feels great. but it doesn't work for all.
25/11/2013 18:01 it's hell of sensationalist too &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:59 feels like, even after yesterday, we have a lot of work to do. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:59 also from skimming this horrible website I can tell these assholes are spreading misunderstanding about mental health which totally donks
25/11/2013 17:58 like, if you can get by without meds, great. I can't, and that is NOT a comment on my character. so fUCK YOU
25/11/2013 17:58 found an outrageous website full of outrageous people yelling about how bad psych meds are. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:48 @hey_yes_wat uh
25/11/2013 15:43 @FleetingMadness that's very sweet of you! I might take you up on that if I have time. that would be very, very nice indeed.
25/11/2013 15:42 I gotta say if I don't get the internship I worked so hard for, today will most certainly be the worst day ever.
25/11/2013 15:41 @FleetingMadness so, you know. :') thanks
25/11/2013 15:40 @FleetingMadness I will be okay thanks for asking. it's a sad day but I understand that it had to happen. and I got to see a video of my cat
25/11/2013 15:23 @horrorwine yesssss so cute
25/11/2013 15:17 thanks everyone for being so sweet I know I've been going on about my cat forever now but ya know. I am very sad.
25/11/2013 15:16 @horrorwine cute things would be great. :') thanks for asking.
25/11/2013 15:07 going to go to my own lab so I can be alone.
25/11/2013 15:07 public crying about my cat who is dying today
25/11/2013 00:28 too cold to poico
25/11/2013 00:11 yay yay yay panel/workshop went sooo well
24/11/2013 03:36 eeeeeeEEEEEEE http://t.co/jKJ3ON11FN
24/11/2013 03:32 a graham cracker crust, for fuck's sake! that's, like, awesome! easy to make and hell of tasty.
24/11/2013 03:31 want to make http://t.co/sypGbnXDyd
24/11/2013 02:55 @Slotheye best fish! Hey I left if anyone asks just say I felt sick. Cannot spin to this music so might as well be at home.
24/11/2013 00:42 .@jwisser 4tbsp flour, sugar, 2tbsp cocoa pwdr, oil, milk. If it doesn't look like cake batter, add 1 egg. Microwave 1 min.
24/11/2013 00:19 or maybe it's not, but I'm holding a grudge and blaming everyone
24/11/2013 00:19 it's some ~real food~ bullshit, let me tell you, that compels otherwise lovely people to condemn me for eating cAKE
24/11/2013 00:18 because it's INSTANT CAKE
24/11/2013 00:17 people would be lining up to ask me the recipe. Seriously.
24/11/2013 00:17 I caught a lot of shit from my friends in Harkness (!!!) for eating mug cake. I feel like on Hall that shit wouldn't fly and ...
24/11/2013 00:17 okay this is bullshit someone who used to give me so much shit for eating mug cake favorited someone's fb status about mug cake.
23/11/2013 23:24 @Slotheye do you object to being made to look like Rainbow Fish y/n (that is the color scheme I am imagining for you)
23/11/2013 22:44 I don't trust anyone whose favorite superhero is deadpool
23/11/2013 22:18 Solarity fish makeup http://t.co/0SieTkNAmS
23/11/2013 20:41 @Slotheye you got it. See you at 7:30!
23/11/2013 20:12 Hey @Slotheye I can help you with your makeup. Could I meet you in pz around 7:30 if you want a hand?
23/11/2013 20:06 @HuhRadio ravenclaws are p sexy
22/11/2013 21:37 @vomeronasal 46 union
22/11/2013 21:24 @Slotheye yep! Come to my house!
22/11/2013 20:13 someone has knocked on my lab door 2x today looking for Ben. Same person both times. I explained that Ben lives somewhere else now.
22/11/2013 20:12 mercifully, I did this in the privacy of my lab.
22/11/2013 20:11 I was so jazzed about having some nice, warm chili on a rainy day, and I just got it everywhere instead.
22/11/2013 20:11 I got chili on my shirt &gt;:\
22/11/2013 19:31 @vomeronasal for B-spot? my house.
22/11/2013 17:57 I have rarely been falling asleep in class lately, but I fell asleep today in NLP ;~; didn't have time to caffeinate beforehand :( :( :(
22/11/2013 16:54 @plaidplaidduck hey, I've been going to bed early this week. no comment on emotional instability.
22/11/2013 16:50 @plaidplaidduck I can handle it.
22/11/2013 16:47 @plaidplaidduck I demand to be at least band manager or makeup artist.
22/11/2013 16:44 @plaidplaidduck only if I can be in the band.
22/11/2013 16:42 did I say inner peace? I meant "barely-controlled agitation."
22/11/2013 16:42 people talking loudly outside my lab are destroying my inner peace.
22/11/2013 16:40 a huge chunk of cream cheese just fell out of my bagel &gt;:\
22/11/2013 16:39 @yak_dad hell yeah! :D awesome. you're the best.
22/11/2013 16:38 @yak_dad We do have a grinder! We use french press or regular drip machine.
22/11/2013 16:37 For the record it was a hilarious gem about me wondering whether or not my shirt was inside-out.
22/11/2013 16:36 Twitter duplicates my tweet. I delete the extra one. Twitter deletes both. ffff!
22/11/2013 15:56 "Is this still Ben's office?" KIND OF. mostly mine &gt;:D
22/11/2013 15:22 This morning may be rough, but I've got a quad mocha up my sleeve. by which I mean I literally spilled my coffee into the sleeve of my coat.
22/11/2013 05:15 Room in the car for 1 more for B-spot tomorrow. Meet at my house (46 Union) 4:30 PM sharp.
22/11/2013 01:52 @vomeronasal hell yeah! come with us! I will drive. :D
22/11/2013 01:51 @Slotheye @TheBardofNight @vomeronasal 4:30 sharp like last time?
22/11/2013 01:47 @vomeronasal it's a nice burger place at crocker park--they have awesome happy hour prices ($5 burger, $3 draft beers)
22/11/2013 01:39 is anyone down to go to the B-spot tomorrow? @TheBardofNight @vomeronasal @Slotheye anyone ???????
22/11/2013 01:21 Lifehack: instead of doing schoolwork, apply for jobs!
21/11/2013 19:39 @jwisser http://t.co/QXtzRULsmZ !! I didn't know about them until I saw them on LinkedIn.
21/11/2013 19:35 I got a JOB INTERVIEW
21/11/2013 16:00 which is truthfully not very much. I just need to assemble a basic worksheet on common mental health problems. woop.
21/11/2013 15:59 ... basically paralyzed by the amount of work I have to do.
21/11/2013 15:59 we're having a massive crunch in preparation for this panel/workshop I'm hosting (which everyone in Oberlin should go to, btw) and I'm ...
21/11/2013 15:58 ugh this week needs to be over. this weekend needs to be over, too.
21/11/2013 15:52 @timaeustoaster I am enjoying your kittycat vicariously through your pictures pls continue posting many :')
21/11/2013 15:47 wow so misery such sad wow nif

21/11/2013 01:35 squIDMAS
21/11/2013 01:35 thx all for the love and support &lt;3
21/11/2013 00:03 @klaauser thanks for the support. :')
20/11/2013 23:55 she is bad-tempered and unfriendly, but she is my cat and I love her and I'm going to miss her so much.
20/11/2013 23:54 I am also sad that she's not going to live past 12 (likely outcome).
20/11/2013 23:54 I had Pepper for 12 years. I am sad that she spent so much of her time being sick (diabetes, poor dental health, little cysts, etc.)
20/11/2013 23:52 and I might not get to see her when I get home, either.
20/11/2013 23:52 my cat definitely has cancer. ;~;

20/11/2013 17:54 there is no point in spinning poi if I'm just going to hit myself because people are walking too close to me.
20/11/2013 17:53 but also "stay for the duration of the event" hahahaha nope I'm staying until it's prohibitively crowded and then getting the fuck out.
20/11/2013 17:53 oh wait I misread it it says "clean up your equipment"
20/11/2013 17:52 if that is a condition for me performing, then *nope*
20/11/2013 17:52 I am NOT taking down the build afterwards. no no no nO NO
20/11/2013 17:51 I'm strongly considering just not doing solarity
20/11/2013 17:51 I guess I wait to eat m&amp;ms until after I've finished my energy drink huh
20/11/2013 17:50 I'm frusticated
20/11/2013 17:50 we also can do little further development until it is fixed
20/11/2013 17:50 something on snackboard broke and I can't fix it ._.
20/11/2013 00:49 massive downside of Kal moving out: the kitchen will smell amAZING less of the time &gt;:\
20/11/2013 00:47 I have completed 6 out of 9. I don't know what this means.
20/11/2013 00:46 we have "short assignments" in NLP. full credit for the short assignment grade if you complete 10. we have had 9 with no sign of any more.
19/11/2013 23:30 pls bring beer now thank
19/11/2013 03:02 If you have both cheese and fries we can be in business.

19/11/2013 02:09 really looking forward to having some cheese fries.
19/11/2013 02:09 100% starfished
18/11/2013 19:05 can I finish this work in 2hr let's go go go go go
18/11/2013 19:04 that is to say: I deserve little praise if any, but I will give myself a congratulatory hug anyway.
18/11/2013 19:04 so let's be real here: one phase of my project effectively has taken about 6 weeks instead of the 1-2 it was s'posed to.
18/11/2013 19:03 now to fix the 5 modules that I haven't touched yet.
18/11/2013 19:03 but here's the thing I just finished fixing all the modules I broke in XenLabs and effectively eliminated a category from my Triage Board.
18/11/2013 19:01 actively avoiding work by making a paper airplane.
18/11/2013 17:07 anyway, oops.
18/11/2013 17:07 he seemed like he was bummed out about his presentation he gave today but it was really very good and his powerpoint was top-notch.
18/11/2013 17:06 wow I just tried to give a compliment to a person on a job well done but accidentally said something backhanded instead. ;~;
18/11/2013 16:06 jsyk I am being overly dramatic here. I do not actually know whether Pepper (cat) has cancer. I am just v worried. she is diabetic also :(
18/11/2013 16:05 @magnetochron that might be possible! what a good idea. :)
18/11/2013 15:50 guys this sucks I am really sad now
18/11/2013 15:50 ... and my older kittycat (not Ping Pong) might have cancer ;~; so I might not get to see ... her ... ever again. ;~;
18/11/2013 15:49 everyone in the lab is talking about going home to see their cats over thanksgiving ;~; I'm not going home until winter break ...
18/11/2013 15:34 (Emphasis mine)
18/11/2013 15:34 @klaauser no the emphasis is mine
18/11/2013 15:25 this was presented at CHI 2013 so it's a real science paper.
18/11/2013 15:25 get it because you tap a touchscreen hahahahahahAHAHAHA
18/11/2013 15:24 DYING rn
18/11/2013 15:24 "...usability of touchscreen interaction... to develop a richer characterization of use, we turned to a previously UNTAPPED source of data"
18/11/2013 06:12 maybe I will listen to a podcast.
18/11/2013 06:12 I guess it will be tomorrow no matter what so I should go to sleep.

13/11/2013 04:58 It's still more money than I've ever spent on a bottle of wine so ya know. I feel p fancy.
13/11/2013 04:58 If you are wondering what I did about wine, I decided to go with a medium priced one that isn't sparkling.
13/11/2013 04:37 I'm sorry I resolved not to post one of those random status generators but I did.
13/11/2013 04:37 ... myself and some of the guns, you have never been much worse.
13/11/2013 04:37 CAKEPHASE NEVER ENDS SATAN IS THE printers, but remember, everyone has two prickly motherfuckers, ...

12/11/2013 17:42 maaaaan my tea is over-steeped. (my life is an acid bath etc)
12/11/2013 17:37 just so everyone knows: the "snow" outside has the approximate properties of Dippin Dots ice cream (minus the flavor part).

12/11/2013 04:12 salt plate sALT PLATE
12/11/2013 02:17 arbitrary desire for expensive things &gt;:\
12/11/2013 02:01 Snow before my birthday! this only bodes ill.
12/11/2013 01:41 apparently it was an exceptional year for the champagne region, grapes-wise, also people drank it all. also what's left is at peak condition
12/11/2013 01:40 okay champagne from my birth year might actually be too expensive.
12/11/2013 01:14 all of it. every topology
12/11/2013 01:13 @theDickUpBear just used a banana peel to model topology.
12/11/2013 01:13 banana math
12/11/2013 01:06 found the perfect bottle, then realized it cost &gt; $300. ;~;
12/11/2013 01:03 this is one of those things that I temporarily obsess over to the point of neglecting work. wine tho.
12/11/2013 01:02 whoa I wonder if I can find an affordable vintage from my birth year D:"
12/11/2013 00:56 I just like excess okay &gt;:\

12/11/2013 00:48 Currently begging parents for bday money so's I can buy fancy wine online. &gt;:D
12/11/2013 00:44 @blaiddxdrwg are you sure? I was under the impression that @yak_dad had 1 and you had 4. better than 0. :'(

08/11/2013 17:53 totally spaced out when my profs said hello to me I am so tired ;~;
08/11/2013 17:30 actual next thing to do is "take self out to lunch" as a reward for working hard and slacking off creatively.
08/11/2013 16:56 next on my list is "clean house" but I do not want to do that. I am very tired.
08/11/2013 16:56 now that my opti hw is done and my meeting with ben is over and my pull request was merged idk what to do with my life.
08/11/2013 16:05 actual 5 min meeting where I handed him a revised schedule and he said "all I want is a stable build by the end of the semester" YOU GOT IT
08/11/2013 16:04 ben kuperman is a merciful god

08/11/2013 14:48 not that it's urgent or anything. I am graduating after all.
08/11/2013 14:48 my advisor cancelled my advising meeting &gt;:\
08/11/2013 14:47 except not yet, I still need to consult bobby boschy on some excel spreadsheets and then talk to ben and then and then and then

08/11/2013 12:19 also a pack of American Spirit yellow for long walks. also maybe some cloves. :sigh: no cigarettes allowed.
08/11/2013 12:18 cigarettes are just awful. I would like a pack of Marlboro Reds pls.
08/11/2013 12:17 I realized that the thing missing from my walks to and from the lab was cigarettes. that is what it was. it was cigarettes.
08/11/2013 12:17 it is time for a cigarette now pls
08/11/2013 12:16 also Fastcar is not accepting credit cards right now and I was too tired to understand that there is an ATM literally right next door

08/11/2013 09:21 a real live programming language in real live development. me! I wrote a thing!
08/11/2013 09:21 if you have not been following with rapt attention and bated breath, this means that I have actually written part of a programming language.
08/11/2013 09:19 :screams: MY CHANGES WERE MERGED
08/11/2013 09:01 new record: have not left my lab for &gt; 3 hrs
08/11/2013 08:55 Mac problems: in Emacs, using the Esc key for Meta and forgetting that you can use the more convenient Alt key on other OSes :\
08/11/2013 08:45 it's my first real all-nighter of the semester. you don't even know how exciting this is.
08/11/2013 08:19 :refreshes page frantically, then remembers that the build robot only updates at two-minute intervals:
08/11/2013 08:17 OH MY GOD MY PULL REQUEST IS BACK AT THE TOP OF THE QUEUE you don't understand how necessary the all-caps are
08/11/2013 08:16 ... needs testing, and 17 modules that are okay!!!
08/11/2013 08:16 triaged xenlabs: only have 4 modules with major errors, 5 modules that require changes, 1 module that needs testing, 1 module that kinda ...
08/11/2013 07:59 solution to my private reading problems: revise schedule. now this thing that was supposed to be done 3 weeks ago will be done next week. :)
08/11/2013 07:53 wow this guy &gt;:\ might be my new favorite emoticon.
08/11/2013 07:52 Performing major triage on XenLabs. Gotta get some of this shit done real fast. &gt;:\
08/11/2013 07:48 AAAAAAAAAAAAA MY PULL REQUEST FAILED OH NO WHYYYY apparently I'm missing a comment somewhere :\
08/11/2013 07:32 it's like look this has taken me 3 weeks of work, what are you expecting to get done in 3 days.
08/11/2013 07:31 this person in the rust irc channel is trying very hard to complete a contribution by learning rust from scratch before monday oops
08/11/2013 07:27 this problem set is infuriating &gt;:(
08/11/2013 06:41 suddenly regretting the placement of my desk near the door in the research lab
08/11/2013 06:36 ah yes beer and a caffeine pill, fourthmeal of champions
08/11/2013 05:58 I guess it is time for a break.
08/11/2013 05:54 grading finished before CS151's class time. Good job, self.
08/11/2013 05:00 I'M WRITING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AAAAAAAAAA
08/11/2013 04:58 oh by the way MY PULL REQUEST WAS APPROVED
08/11/2013 04:58 good thing I have locked myself in my lab for the night. work work work work.
08/11/2013 04:54 (freezing?) rain and wind tonight. I feel sorry for anyone trying to come home from the safer sex dance. :&lt;
08/11/2013 02:27 I'll probably just end up submitting both. &gt;:(
08/11/2013 02:26 what is the difference between a facility scheduling request and a room reservation request? I just don't know.
07/11/2013 19:48 the Thursday story :&lt;
07/11/2013 19:47 :sighs heavily: I am just gonna be up all goddamn night because I've been slacking off so much lately.
07/11/2013 19:46 acting as if I am not totally fucking swamped today.
07/11/2013 19:45 I sat in the lab, pushed my latest commit, then proceeded to answer my email and lurk on IRC.
07/11/2013 06:07 http://t.co/asDwsRYCIn
07/11/2013 02:55 this saltybet is just about as interesting as watching rust compile and run through the test suite. that is to say: not at all.
07/11/2013 01:50 @yak_dad @theDickUpBear I like any kind! usually a Tay likes dark roasts? I like lighter ones but I just like coffee in general.
07/11/2013 01:46 babby's first contribution gets style revisions.
06/11/2013 23:04 Stressed out so hard over rust that I took a mental health day to recover. :sighs heavily: I donked up.
06/11/2013 22:52 @theDickUpBear I might be down
06/11/2013 06:31 Time to hit the reset button on today. Too much excitement for one Nif.
06/11/2013 03:14 aaaaaAAAAAA
06/11/2013 03:14 I wanna go into the lab and fix these issues right now but I'm totally incapacitated.
06/11/2013 03:12 I'm getting ALL THE FEEDBACK on my bad style OH MY GOD I am so embarrassed
06/11/2013 03:11 oH MY GOD I left stupid comments in my code
06/11/2013 03:01 my application looks good, according to the project mentor and the other people in charge! yaaaaaayyyy
06/11/2013 02:23 Everything is great!
06/11/2013 02:21 @Tantoes_ if you don't already have one I've been sitting on "Archduke Franzia Ferdinand" for awhile
06/11/2013 01:12 :whimpers softly: I was told my application looked strong and I am the first person to apply to work on Rust so uh ;~; pls
06/11/2013 01:10 I guess now I can get back to real life.
06/11/2013 01:09 this is starting to get real. I'm gonna get REAL FEEDBACK on my grimy code. whoa. :rolls around on the floor:
06/11/2013 01:01 also sent my first pull request. &gt;:D babby's first contribution.
06/11/2013 01:01 sent in my application to the Gnome OPW internship. BA-KOW.
06/11/2013 00:23 @Tantoes_ @theDickUpBear not planning on it tonight. :\ sorry.
06/11/2013 00:22 @Androooou @BvBunny I make a joke about P and NP and the P/NP deadline every year and nobody thinks it's funny &gt;:(
05/11/2013 23:27 becoming consumed by work :\
05/11/2013 21:39 @TheLoosha @FleetingMadness @blaiddxdrwg I am registered in the wrong county :( usually I vote absentee.
05/11/2013 17:35 I 100% forgot to vote :&lt;
05/11/2013 17:27 luckily my aggressive chmodding seems not to have caused any problems ... this time.
05/11/2013 17:23 there is no response, only despair.
05/11/2013 17:23 "you use sudo to change the permissions on fucking everything why don't you just sudo the original command?" I ask myself.
05/11/2013 17:22 "come on nif, why didn't you just use sudo?" the eternal question. the life story.
05/11/2013 03:23 Super high school level punctuality
05/11/2013 02:57 @TheBardofNight yeeeess
05/11/2013 02:54 @TheBardofNight I'm at home but I can be persuaded to move esp. if you wanted to go to the Feve or something.
05/11/2013 02:48 @TheBardofNight like at a place or at home???
05/11/2013 02:38 I would like beer now pls
05/11/2013 02:36 painted my nails the same color as my bag. yep. yes, I did.
05/11/2013 01:13 why did I not clone rust from github why did I install it the regular way why oh why
05/11/2013 00:03 I feel like I /should/ be sick but nothing is actually wrong with me.
04/11/2013 23:49 I've been referring to caffeine as "'feine" in my head for weeks and I finally said it out loud. it's way dumber than I thought it was.
04/11/2013 23:34 wow this dude who might :fingers crossed: be my project mentor on this internship I want seems like a totally awesome person.
04/11/2013 23:08 @AlexWardy1 oh weird. go to your BIOS sometime and crank up the fan. you're probably having issues with overheating.
04/11/2013 23:03 @AlexWardy1 wait are you using a desktop computer at school?
04/11/2013 22:29 @AlexWardy1 ugh, I feel that. I even got the battery, fan, and trackpad replaced on mine &lt; 1 year ago. some bullshit all around.
04/11/2013 22:28 you can still look at my code tho idc
04/11/2013 22:28 oops wrong acct
04/11/2013 22:27 https://t.co/LvM0fjcSxe you can see what's going on here! Basically I went from 0 to 60 in 2 weeks w/r/t Rust.
04/11/2013 22:25 @eatthebrownie thanks for your support :')
04/11/2013 22:22 came home for some me-time. as much as I am ambivalent towards this expression: I am Out Of Spoons.

04/11/2013 02:12 @aDoctorMoon y y y :)
04/11/2013 01:43 I wish I could cry but I physically cannot
04/11/2013 01:42 Friends who saw the show tonight: pls don't hold me in contempt.
04/11/2013 01:36 ...that I have 0 standards for myself and that I am a dumb slacker.
04/11/2013 01:35 This year's performance (mine, not everyone else's) was just unacceptable. this is not who I thought I was. Everyone is right to believe ...
04/11/2013 01:34 I want to forget about this so hard. Let's just pretend the circus was yesterday and Friday and that's it. Or never at all.
04/11/2013 01:31 I want to go home and get wasted.
04/11/2013 01:26 ... Hit herself repeatedly, and try to call it a performance. I am not looking for pity or anything just let me leave this here.
04/11/2013 01:25 Strangers are going to see me and they are going to only know me as a complete hack and an idiot who has the audacity to get on stage ...
04/11/2013 01:24 I think I am going to go home before bows because I am over this and I do not want to be here or face the audience again.
04/11/2013 01:23 ... To do well at the programming contest, get this internship, or get good grades this semester.
04/11/2013 01:23 Now I get to imagine all of the other ways I am going to fail in the near future. Like I should probably just assume that I am not going ...
04/11/2013 01:21 It's like, if I needed any confirmation that I am an actual failure, that was it.
04/11/2013 01:20 That was the absolute worst performance I have ever given. The audience actually laughed at me when I hit myself. I am such a hack.
04/11/2013 01:19 @aDoctorMoon i feel like I really let you down I am so sorry :'(
03/11/2013 22:40 I'm not sure I *get* what we're reading for HCI tomorrow :\
03/11/2013 20:52 I'm nifsplaining some taysperiences :\
03/11/2013 06:04 do you havE ANY FUCKING IDEA WHAT TIME IT IS
03/11/2013 04:39 Also the poi were on the wrong setting? The setting I wanted and the setting I got (v fast strobe) look almost identical when still.
03/11/2013 04:37 ... Then pull them apart and continue.
03/11/2013 04:36 Luckily I can predict the two places where they will happen so I know what to do next: give them 5 sec of activity to undo themselves ...
03/11/2013 04:35 I honestly think my act is aided slightly from tangles because they provide some interesting texture.
03/11/2013 04:34 Poi report for show 3: tangling never looked so awesome. Flawless finish. Lots of applause thx everyone :)
03/11/2013 04:24 @jwisser yes. I found a cheat code to unlock all the levels and it suddenly became much more fun.
02/11/2013 22:17 :squeaks exuberantly: I may have finished this patch.
02/11/2013 22:08 :shakes violently with excitement: I got my code to compile
02/11/2013 20:49 even though it's a knockoff I still underpaid for it so yay :)
02/11/2013 20:40 newbag bluebag (nif shown for scale) http://t.co/qSVv4PUTLC
02/11/2013 20:38 but it is big and blue and beautiful and seems v sturdy and it holds all my things!
02/11/2013 20:37 So the satchel I bought on eBay was in fact a knockoff and I would have discerned this from the listing had I been a little more careful.
02/11/2013 02:56 also propranolol wore off so I got the shakes real bad just as my second performance was starting. &gt;:(
02/11/2013 02:55 circus poi act report: show 1 - major, obscene tangle, good recovery, good finish. show 2 - no tangle, mediocre finish, hit self in the ass.
01/11/2013 22:06 @zelukester @theDickUpBear 8:00!!

31/10/2013 16:35 in the spirit of spookiness I should change my "devel" folder to a "devil" folder
31/10/2013 16:32 Ben Kuperman gave all of his CS 151 graders a $25 gift card to fastcar bless him :')
31/10/2013 16:32 I need to stop favoriting everyone's halloween tweets but they're too funny ;~; if I were cleverer and had more time-energy I would be a Tay

30/10/2013 04:57 @Panahinuva :&lt; well damn
30/10/2013 04:56 @Panahinuva any good emulators out there for mac?
30/10/2013 04:52 if saltybet isn't the best activity for when you don't feel like sleeping idk what is.
30/10/2013 01:44 @horrorwine @orashaboogie by which I mean I do not think one is planned but we can bring it up with the director and cast.
30/10/2013 01:43 @horrorwine @orashaboogie hmmmmm there are naked people so we'd have to get everyone's permission and stuff? but it's possible!
30/10/2013 00:20 it is so great when people are good at things.
30/10/2013 00:16 the sudden realization that you're a total hack a few days before the performance.
30/10/2013 00:14 burlesque of many bodies and genders!!!
29/10/2013 20:42 @verticaltrout oh no I wish I had thought to spread the word sooner! It is so early this year.
29/10/2013 18:42 @verticaltrout this weekend!
29/10/2013 18:42 This kid in cs 151 has very obviously downloaded some "top 1000 greatest classical musix" compilation and listens to it every week.
29/10/2013 01:41 oh my goodness the sexy automata are gonna be the cutest pls come see the circus
29/10/2013 01:37 oh my gOD

29/10/2013 01:29 really, I'm not interested in anyone's bullshit!
29/10/2013 01:29 the extent to which I am NOT INTERESTED in Dragonhead's bullshit today ... ... ...
29/10/2013 00:07 ugh rehearsal
28/10/2013 22:14 better than crying alone in the lab: answering emails.
28/10/2013 16:22 I have now put "relax" into my calendar from 5-6PM today. I feel a little better.
28/10/2013 14:39 @HuhRadio I always get hunger mixed up with needing to pee. don't ask me how.
28/10/2013 14:35 confusing the feeling of sadness with needing to poop.
28/10/2013 14:29 I'm just going to admire this print statement for awhile. "key: 1, value: taco;" it says.
28/10/2013 14:26 Like I understand why the psychiatrists don't write refills but COME ON I'VE BEEN ON THESE MEDS FOR 2.5 YEARS
28/10/2013 14:24 I get to take my meds today. *_*
28/10/2013 06:27 never bet on final fantasy
28/10/2013 06:17 okay finally I have made a correct decision it earns me one invisible dollar
28/10/2013 06:16 betting on Ness because Tay just beat Earthbound
28/10/2013 06:11 @bricksii lol, well, saltybet is real shitty, but I meant one AI's starting stance was too close to the other's.
28/10/2013 06:03 ugh waifu you let me down
28/10/2013 06:00 @bricksii I guess it's a saltybet thing? if you are unfamiliar it is where you bet on fighting game AIs to fight each other across platforms
28/10/2013 05:59 ALWAYS BET ON DISRESPECT
28/10/2013 05:56 *losing at saltybet alone what is my life @CannedNirvana @JonnyQuirke
28/10/2013 05:52 playing saltybet alone what is my life
28/10/2013 04:07 "Smooth criminal" plays but I am disappointed/This corroborates my idea that people born in the '90s cannot truly appreciate Michael Jackson
28/10/2013 04:00 The art at the feve is actually kind of interesting and kinda cartoony rn
28/10/2013 03:58 This peacock is impossible. What an impossible peacock. What a good name for a band. I say all this while admiring art at the feve.
28/10/2013 03:55 I am a busy biddy
28/10/2013 03:54 I am so stoked about all of my projects but I only have so much time and energy for all of them.
28/10/2013 03:43 @TheBardofNight where r u
28/10/2013 03:28 @TheBardofNight be there soon. Don't go anywhere.
28/10/2013 03:25 @TheBardofNight wait are you still feve
28/10/2013 03:24 @TheBardofNight this is excellent news

27/10/2013 05:22 It is a nif http://t.co/Q3e1mVN8n3
26/10/2013 04:03 @TheBardofNight basically what I am saying is I will commit to buying a ticket right now if you will go with me.
26/10/2013 03:58 @TheBardofNight I don't have any exams
25/10/2013 23:25 shrub shrub shrub apple shrub
25/10/2013 23:15 @orashaboogie right, okay. well huh. I mean they have a kid to take care of now so maybe neither of them will be consistently full-time.
25/10/2013 23:11 @orashaboogie @BvBunny (I don't really know how tenure works I just know it's good)
25/10/2013 23:11 @orashaboogie @BvBunny is that mutually exclusive with Tom getting tenure? idk man, the dept is growing so fast and we need many profs.
25/10/2013 23:09 @orashaboogie and now you know where you can get your own! what cute shoes, what a cute Cynthia.
25/10/2013 23:00 @blaiddxdrwg relevant: my CS prof wears these to class every day: http://t.co/AWgqgFOH0w
25/10/2013 22:50 @blaiddxdrwg SO CUTE
25/10/2013 22:49 now I shall sit back and enjoy my lava cakes and oatmeal stout with the satisfaction of a day well spent.
25/10/2013 22:48 and I already bought alcohol so there is that
25/10/2013 22:47 don't worry friends I put aside oodles of cash so I have plenty for rent/groceries
25/10/2013 22:46 ~impulse buy~ :D
25/10/2013 22:44 http://t.co/TQ4FnoUGVP yes http://t.co/odFNE5sAfQ very yes
25/10/2013 21:41 (please ebay don't let me get scammed this is the first time I've tried buying "designer" items)
25/10/2013 21:38 Bought myself a Cambridge Satchel on Ebay because it's almost my birthday.
25/10/2013 20:55 :In Homestar Runner's voice: A tall glass of...Franzia.
25/10/2013 20:55 did u no: Franzia has the perfect mix of potency and palatability for a drinking game! also it's $3/liter!
25/10/2013 20:54 today is a day to shop online and not do work
25/10/2013 20:53 @aDoctorMoon If I had $1 for every time that happened to me... I still would not have been tipped properly. (I feel u)
25/10/2013 20:19 all I'm saying is I need those shoes immediately.
25/10/2013 20:18 :chokes on soda: http://t.co/zhd2uikCT7
25/10/2013 20:14 modcloth has velvet? leggings??? I won't wear leggings but my urge to wear anything that is velvet is stronger.
25/10/2013 19:49 my advisor is up for tenure!!!!!
25/10/2013 02:34 I have a lot of work to do and I could have been doing work instead of losing a stupid game.
24/10/2013 23:56 @klaauser :D :D :D
24/10/2013 23:50 Spent an hour puzzling over a compiler error when I realized I hadn't implemented the functions I was referencing. Welp.
24/10/2013 01:50 :sees typos, automatically assumes that site offering scholarships is a scam, leaves immediately:
24/10/2013 01:45 (I ran out of pasta)
24/10/2013 01:44 we do what we must because we can, and what we must do is make rice so we have some starch to put this vodka sauce on
24/10/2013 01:22 New public/professional account @nif_ward
23/10/2013 23:39 the safeword is *obnoxious bird noise*
23/10/2013 23:11 I think it's just overheating.
23/10/2013 23:11 my workstation does not believe in a "bootable device"
23/10/2013 02:13 @yak_dad yes sry should clarify I mean the programming syntax "::"
23/10/2013 01:54 double colons look yucky
23/10/2013 01:12 this language is so confusing ;~; maybe if I knew C better I wouldn't be in this mess.
23/10/2013 00:33 rust is grimy as hell
22/10/2013 18:07 @ettrix by which I mean, you are perfect (and I miss you)
22/10/2013 18:06 @ettrix it is perfect
21/10/2013 21:50 what a mess, what a mess.
21/10/2013 21:49 there is a BIOS jumper inside the box and when you move it, it will actually go to the BIOS screen instead of freaking out and tryna log in.
21/10/2013 21:48 after opening the computerbox to force it to take me to the BIOS screen, I am now able to reinstall Ubuntu. :(
21/10/2013 21:27 my computer won't shut off when I tell it to anymore.
21/10/2013 21:13 I am so over today
21/10/2013 21:10 now my computer is all messed up and it is really upset
21/10/2013 21:02 @jwisser I will give it a try
21/10/2013 21:02 @jwisser right yeah umm...I'm not sure!
21/10/2013 21:00 @jwisser I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MKDIR ;~; ;~; ;~;
21/10/2013 21:00 @jwisser I did chmod -R /usr/ ;~; ;~; ;~; on my Ubuntu 12 workstation in the research lab
21/10/2013 20:58 I didn't know any better and now I have to reinstall everything ;~;
21/10/2013 20:58 oh no I did a dumb unix thing ohhhh nooooooo
21/10/2013 01:57 @BvBunny must be! I will look for it.
20/10/2013 22:30 @bricksii I tried using firebug to see what was going on and it seems like everything is legit. :\ I will give it a closer look tho
20/10/2013 21:57 @jwisser I'm giving up on this for now I think and I will come back to it tomorrow. then, everything will have been illuminated.
20/10/2013 21:57 @jwisser yep, it is. :&lt;
20/10/2013 21:56 @jwisser oooh, good point. I'll check.
20/10/2013 21:55 @jwisser hm! no, I'm not sure. I'll try moving some things around.
20/10/2013 21:54 @jwisser it's for a drupal site and the theme is stored in a bunch of little subfolders and idk where I'm being overwritten from. thx neway!
20/10/2013 21:53 @jwisser it's in several files :\
20/10/2013 21:53 @jwisser this is probably gonna require an in-depth look at my code so idk what you can even do anyway :(
20/10/2013 21:52 @jwisser lol, no, it's all good, but yeah: that's the thing that seems to be malfunctioning.
20/10/2013 21:52 @magnetochron @jwisser I have splattered that p much everywhere it could possibly be relevant, still shows bullets in lists ;~;
20/10/2013 21:49 @jwisser yes
20/10/2013 21:49 If you know CSS, pls help: how do I get rid of bullets in lists?  I have tried literally everything, including !important
20/10/2013 19:07 people could bring me food.
20/10/2013 19:07 seriously though what if I never left the lab. or if I left the lab, what if I only went to the other lab.
20/10/2013 19:06 I must go from the base camp to the sadness fortress. it will be a long journey. I have packed food and oxygen and a tent. wish me luck.
20/10/2013 19:05 anger mountain is where I live. sometimes my agitation causes avalanches.
20/10/2013 19:04 the sadness fortress is found in a cave near the summit of anger mountain.
20/10/2013 18:52 v pleased by how close pittsburgh is to oberlin
20/10/2013 18:44 RT @sextsfromthehal: Sext: Sleep deprivation is attractive to me because it lets me know you've been busy.
19/10/2013 22:17 fall break...fall break for ever ...
19/10/2013 21:30 I guess this isn't so dumb, but it's extra dumb anyway.
19/10/2013 21:29 this SUCKS.
19/10/2013 20:35 I spose it's a handy way of proving your mettle but also free work for all these companies I guess
19/10/2013 20:34 okay so this internship sounds perfect except for the part where I have to write something and submit it before I am accepted y this tho
19/10/2013 20:34 it's not for me, it's for an internship
19/10/2013 20:32 so I guess I will learn Rust
18/10/2013 19:19 @yak_dad @Slotheye @theDickUpBear @BvBunny nom nom nom anyway we leave promptly at 4:30 so we're sure not to miss happy hour prices
18/10/2013 19:18 @Slotheye @theDickUpBear @BvBunny it's in crocker park, cheap good burgers + beer during happy hour
18/10/2013 18:23 @BvBunny I haven't really tried to look at it outside the lab, but I have a hunch that you have to jump through some hoops to do so
18/10/2013 18:09 I think I'll just make this font bigger until I have to go to class.
18/10/2013 18:04 @jwisser interesting! well, if it suddenly starts growing, it might be a migraine-type thing. if not, then... I have no idea.
18/10/2013 18:01 @jwisser ocular migraine.
18/10/2013 17:55 great moments in SnackBoard history: that time just now when I figured out how to make the font bigger :3
18/10/2013 17:19 @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight you got it
18/10/2013 15:50 entire prospie family!
18/10/2013 15:48 I really was just lucky because the school district was well-funded so
18/10/2013 15:48 here let me wave my dick around and act cool because I went to a big soul-crushing public school instead of a nice private school
18/10/2013 15:47 my graduating class had 741 people
18/10/2013 15:47 so my high school is the 2nd largest in Ohio with 2714 students currently ?
18/10/2013 14:35 OH: Student--"...take the thing and add it to the thing that's already there--" Kuperman--"You mean increment it."
18/10/2013 14:30 MY CLASSES RULE maybe I should spend some time doing work for them instead of tweeting idk
18/10/2013 14:30 basically we learned some technique today in NLP that I was basically like I KNOW THE INTEGER PROGRAM FOR THIS I LEARNED IT YESTERDAY
18/10/2013 14:28 might necessarily exclude me from working with friends tho :(
18/10/2013 14:28 Theresa said I could double up on projects for NLP and optimization b/c they're due at the same time. now to ask Bob. this could be good.
18/10/2013 14:27 I think professors are great and talking to them is awesome.
18/10/2013 14:27 bragged to my advisor about how awesome I am. he seemed pleased, but wants me to not take this 300-level math class P/NP.
17/10/2013 18:37 you can actually go to http://t.co/E3nAN4Cnb6 and stare into the void that will become SnackBoard.
17/10/2013 18:36 omg omg omg omg snackboard snackboard snackboard snackboard
17/10/2013 01:49 anyway I'm just saying ready your livers it's a saturday and I'm doing a shitty Oberlin bar crawl with or without you.

17/10/2013 01:41 RT @Fish4EDM: Remember: you don't have to take shit from anyone who brings a drawstring backpack to work
17/10/2013 01:40 @TheBardofNight unless mixer doesn't matter to you in which case you should have some of this nasty vodka. :D house is here to help.
17/10/2013 01:39 @TheBardofNight bring some mixer home we have a handle after all
17/10/2013 01:19 @TheBardofNight oh noooo
17/10/2013 01:19 @ettrix @klaauser okay alarming is the wrong word entirely. let us say "unexpected"
17/10/2013 01:11 @ettrix @klaauser I can corroborate this. also it is slightly alarming when you feel someone's smooth/stubbly arm next to yours
16/10/2013 19:08 I just want to do schoolwork!
16/10/2013 19:08 I realized why I am so frustrated with today: I have a ton of obligations, but none of them are academic in nature. fuck!
16/10/2013 18:18 drupal whyyyyyy
16/10/2013 18:17 @bricksii ;D &lt;3
16/10/2013 18:17 @bricksii I would say I'm sorry but I'm not, really.
16/10/2013 14:17 I'm just unnecessarily aggravated over one person's fb status and I'm tweeting about it.
16/10/2013 14:16 false analogy, probably, but either way K-12 education and AI are two separate issues. like seriously, go fucking learn how your compy works
16/10/2013 14:15 back to that thing I was on last night: all this anti-technology bullshit really smacks of "you can't hug your children with nuclear arms!"
16/10/2013 14:10 slightly concerned about this extremely elaborate ocircus script but the directors seem really on top of their shit so...
16/10/2013 14:01 as the user and a software developer, I am my own worst enemy.
16/10/2013 13:58 maybe I got hacked! phished! users are the enemy! users are insecure! damn it all!
16/10/2013 13:58 that was fucking bizarre. it wouldn't let me log in because I had attempted too many logins in the past hour (during which I was in class)
16/10/2013 13:57 What happened to my twitter?????
16/10/2013 04:50 I look like someone who does not sleep.
16/10/2013 04:47 Whatever! I can't adequately express myself right now but I have disdain for people who don't appreciate /practical, applied/ CS.
16/10/2013 04:45 Or like "we spend so much $ on AI research but what about our children?????" What EVER
16/10/2013 04:44 Okay look I don't care if you don't trust technology but like disavowing the field of machine learning because it's too scary...whatever.
16/10/2013 04:30 I like work so much I might look for a job
16/10/2013 04:30 Work rox
16/10/2013 04:30 I am slightly inebriated and I could sleep but like I am awake why don't I take advantage of this time and do some work
16/10/2013 04:24 @locuscoeruleus @HuhRadio @magnetochron @horrorwine @Slotheye @TheBardofNight I must be @theDickUpBear

15/10/2013 16:45 I think getting back into caffeine gave me a huge boost, but now that I've become acclimated to it again I'm the same sleepy fucker as usual
15/10/2013 16:39 @Slotheye groovy. we'll find some time. :)
15/10/2013 16:37 @Slotheye aight! I might have a little time before dinner?

15/10/2013 16:32 oh I'm sorry this is the internet please correct every instance of dog to doge
15/10/2013 16:32 dogs are alright
15/10/2013 16:32 a big gangly labradoodle with basically no attention span but who will someday find the Shortest Path to wherever it is he's going.
15/10/2013 16:31 or it was yesterday anyway he's a really cute dog.
15/10/2013 16:30 one of the few dogs I really, really like: the Sharxler dog, Bellman Ford. It's his birthday!
15/10/2013 16:21 I put too much cheese in my chili this is extra grossssssss
15/10/2013 16:21 this is the nightosphere. you gotta swim the proper channels.
15/10/2013 16:19 don't let me answer my phone don't let me answer my phone don't let me answer my phone is it funny yet am I funny?!?!
15/10/2013 16:14 @Slotheye if you want to practice a thing sometime hit me up and we can flowarts together! more people = less awkward imo
15/10/2013 02:18 "Don't let me answer my phone. I'm sad so leave me alone." --Danny brown
15/10/2013 01:34 okay serious eats drinks, I am just not interested in sommeliers. I want to know about some badass cocktails and maybe people who make them.
14/10/2013 23:35 really into the Fastcar soundtrack tonight.
14/10/2013 23:22 :sighs heavily: so many things to do.
14/10/2013 22:39 @cureGore @locuscoeruleus @TheBardofNight I really want "kouhai noticed me" to be a thing b/c I say it way too often about 2 many ppl
14/10/2013 18:25 I /should/ do work this week... :\
14/10/2013 18:24 okay pencil-and-desk one-dude jam-session you can stop anytime
14/10/2013 18:20 I should do lots of work this week.
14/10/2013 14:50 I am going to have a buttload of stuff to do over fall break but w/e
14/10/2013 14:49 cheerfully slacking off
14/10/2013 14:39 @FleetingMadness right tho? it makes sense by the end of the episode more or less
14/10/2013 14:20 @yak_dad @theDickUpBear it's definitely possible! we would love to, but we'll see what the funds situation is
14/10/2013 14:19 @jwisser :D bless
14/10/2013 14:14 ... and social, and then I caffeinate. So, you know. just take me in stride, and sorry for my persistent tweetspam.
14/10/2013 14:14 ... are now administered in megatons and are still wearing off. my night meds make me really stupid. my morning meds make me energetic ...
14/10/2013 14:13 you guys I'm so sorry I get so loopy in the mornings/early afternoons it's right after I take my meds and my meds from the night before ...
14/10/2013 14:03 @horrorwine I'm on it
14/10/2013 14:02 not because you are unable to tell the difference b/w a computer and actual sci-fi hall but because it would be THAT GOOD
14/10/2013 14:01 I could make a twitter acct that would say shit like "hhld" and "I hecked up I'm trash" and you couldn't distinguish it from a people
14/10/2013 14:00 or like using Sci-Fi hall's tweets as a corpus (with y'all's permission of course) for sentiment analysis, Markov chains, what have you
14/10/2013 13:59 sentiment analysis in chat transcripts --&gt; automatic mood journaling AUGH I'd be so into that as a consumer I always forget to track my mood
14/10/2013 13:58 ugh every time I go to NLP I think of a new idea for the final project what do I even do
14/10/2013 00:44 wow pear vodka currently infusing tastes better than pears or vodka
13/10/2013 21:10 Aaaaaaa someone else besides the corporation itself uses "bbw" to mean "bath and body works" DID NOBODY THINK TO GOOGLE THIS @theDickUpBear
13/10/2013 21:05 @magnetochron if u ever want to discuss this at length sometime just shoot me a dm. I like talking about this sort of thing.
12/10/2013 23:49 http://t.co/Kz0wWv64MH want ????????
12/10/2013 21:03 doing work is great and all but I'd kind of just like to take a bath
12/10/2013 19:56 my blisters are gross i popped one and it sprayed @theDickUpBear
12/10/2013 19:21 (please ignore the fact that the pizza car comes to our house at least 2x/wk)
12/10/2013 19:20 next-door losers are getting pizza hahahaha

11/10/2013 19:17 actually I'm having a full-sugar soda and some peach rings
11/10/2013 19:17 sugar is good, sugar is great, let's refuel for this event with a piece of chocolate cake.
11/10/2013 19:01 one productive day makes up for a mostly unproductive week, right?
11/10/2013 18:57 networking with trustees tonight!
11/10/2013 18:56 @blaiddxdrwg sorry I don't mean to like one-up you or wave my dick around. just commiserating. :)
11/10/2013 18:53 @blaiddxdrwg he also demanded that I get off the bus and go on an adventure/date with him
11/10/2013 18:52 @blaiddxdrwg oof. yeah. bus nightmares. one time this guy slept ON me, and when I tried to push him off, called me a bitch.
11/10/2013 17:13 like okay I need to buy groceries. gas for my car. I have plenty for rent/internet/utilities OH THE INTERNET that's what I need to buy
11/10/2013 17:12 :frowns deeply: I cannot budget and I am confused
11/10/2013 17:09 the shoes I'm wearing today are both too small and falling off my feet!
11/10/2013 17:09 they used to all fit! now no new shoe I buy fits!
11/10/2013 17:08 something happened to me and all of a sudden I cannot wear shoes like I used to :(
11/10/2013 17:00 I am actually having kind of a hard time writing. but typing is okay for now.
11/10/2013 17:00 I have the shakes :(
11/10/2013 15:58 paralyzed with work
10/10/2013 21:29 Yuck male gaze
10/10/2013 20:52 why mess with success ya know?
10/10/2013 20:51 mad warm fuzzies from my competitive programming partner who wants to be on a team with me again for the big regional contest
10/10/2013 20:51 I have this problem where if given a take-home test with a specific time-frame I will take up the entire time with procrastinating
10/10/2013 20:49 I had to move like 3 things off the standby list onto the main list ;~;
10/10/2013 20:49 what happened to my to do list it is suddenly so long ;~;
10/10/2013 20:45 @theDickUpBear planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks planks EVERYBODY

10/10/2013 20:40 I can't do work
10/10/2013 20:40 I can't do work unless
10/10/2013 20:40 I can't do work unless I'm eating at the same time
10/10/2013 20:32 I can't go to the feve for dinner again this week I can't go to the feve for dinner again this week I can't--FUCK IT
10/10/2013 18:30 @blaiddxdrwg I know that feeling :(
10/10/2013 18:29 @aoitheangry better believe it
10/10/2013 17:42 The phrase "I hecked up" comes to mind.
10/10/2013 17:41 It's a good thing I am medicated against despair
10/10/2013 17:40 I slept instead of spending several hours on a take home math test.
10/10/2013 06:18 I did no work tonight :pride:
10/10/2013 06:18 I would almost go downstairs and make drunk-ass mac 'n' cheese instead of sleeping
10/10/2013 06:17 why is a future
10/10/2013 06:17 followed a "weird twitter" dude just because their icon is Coach McGuirk #homemovies
10/10/2013 03:16 @klaauser you might be onto something. beer and cream? milk?
10/10/2013 03:16 maybe not all beer
10/10/2013 03:16 but what if you made easy mac with beer instead of water
10/10/2013 03:12 I also am more than a little ashamed that I like racist baseball teams.
10/10/2013 03:12 it's nice to have atlanta sports as a backup when Cleveland inevitably fails but :(
10/10/2013 03:07 would rather watch opera with my baby ghost @theDickUpBear than do work
10/10/2013 02:51 @HuhRadio :(  :(  :( sorry bb. better luck next year? I do love the postseason so I know the sadness.
09/10/2013 19:19 @bricksii it's true. I'm not really sure we needed it in those quantities. Pyle as a co-op has high caloric/snacking requirements tho.
09/10/2013 18:05 FUCK IT I'm gonna go deposit this check instead of working
09/10/2013 17:53 anyway what I'm saying is any OSCAns from last year that might be on here should check their mail/OCMRs
09/10/2013 17:47 or didn't dump gallons of heavy whipping cream into every Friday lunch
09/10/2013 17:46 Keep's was like $180! maybe they starved a little tho
09/10/2013 17:46 but for reference the next lowest refund amount (for a full spring semester) was KHC, which was over $20 more than Pyle's refund.
09/10/2013 17:45 okay okay okay okay to put things in perspective it is SUPER GREAT to get $70 in your OCMR for any reason.
09/10/2013 17:44 &lt; $70 for almost an entire semester during which you REFUSED TO BUY EARTH BALANCE?!!?
09/10/2013 17:44 pyLE YOU SCREWED ME OVER
09/10/2013 16:41 Needless to say I missed class. :(
09/10/2013 16:41 I woke up every hour for the second night in a row, culminating in irreversible wakefulness at 5:30 am. Slept until now to compensate.
09/10/2013 16:40 Ugh. Damn. Something is messed up about my sleeps.
08/10/2013 23:22 come to trivia, get interviewed for the revolutionary technology that will change your life forever: SnackBoard
08/10/2013 23:18 @Panahinuva bleah. Sorry for your lots :(
08/10/2013 23:09 @yak_dad @mister_inkwell soooo haaaat
08/10/2013 22:52 @Panahinuva yeah alright. well. follow your heart, ya know
08/10/2013 22:50 @Panahinuva shipped to you from your house that's still &lt; $40
08/10/2013 22:49 @Panahinuva I guess if that is the case I'd try sticking it out and seeing what happens. even if you have to pay a little more to get it ...
08/10/2013 22:47 @Panahinuva oh :( yeah I see
08/10/2013 22:47 @Panahinuva if you can do that, I would say that's your best bet, and then you're extricated from that mess forever
08/10/2013 22:46 PARSEVAL == parsifal???
08/10/2013 22:45 @Panahinuva that's butts. I'm sorry to hear that. :( :( :(
08/10/2013 22:44 @Panahinuva oh no wat hapen (I used to work for Gamestop so I like to bash them)
08/10/2013 22:43 suddenly I don't feel like the department loser/failure. I don't know who is, but it's not me anymore. :)
08/10/2013 22:42 basically, I'm gonna wave my dick about knowing the CKY algorithm and Chomsky normal forms all around these post-151 CS babies
08/10/2013 22:42 before they were taken out, that is. I understand the entirety of the reading is what I'm saying.
08/10/2013 22:41 feeling important and special b/c I understand the parts of this reading that were redacted/simplified for the class
08/10/2013 22:35 I'm sorry I've just been thinking that ever since I looked at this textbook and I need to let it out
08/10/2013 22:35 Jurafsky and Martin's Speech and Language Processing more like GIRAFFE-sky and martin
08/10/2013 20:57 today I am eating
08/10/2013 20:56 pewpewpew shooting down emails like it's my job
08/10/2013 01:04 @ettrix huh! I get ocular migraines myself.
08/10/2013 01:01 @ettrix whoa wait describe this phenomenon
07/10/2013 21:45 Ordinarily I would not tolerate this fly walking on me but its little feets are so tickly and cute
07/10/2013 21:43 @Slotheye I feel feve-erish at least 1x/week so let's definitely go sometime
07/10/2013 21:38 ran into Cynthia and Gentleman at Feve. "...Are you doing work here? I'm impressed!"
07/10/2013 21:37 confusing the urge to pee with hunger
07/10/2013 21:37 confusing the urge to sneeze with the urge to vomit
07/10/2013 21:37 asked for fries, got tots instead. this would not be a problem for anyone but me b/c tots and beer make me SO SICK
07/10/2013 21:08 @theDickUpBear did u seriously just change your name to baby ghost because omg I love you
07/10/2013 21:03 @blaiddxdrwg lol thx much :) I am fine actually just had to get it all out
07/10/2013 20:58 @Slotheye actually my feve craving is extreme so I think I must go there instead sorry :/
07/10/2013 20:56 @Slotheye yeah when??
07/10/2013 20:53 I am starting to get upset because I know I am going to throw up
07/10/2013 20:52 I think Fastcar iced tea makes me throw up
07/10/2013 20:48 @jwisser :(
07/10/2013 20:48 would anyone want to go to the feve with me for dinner? I've got a craving.
07/10/2013 19:08 picking up the Grape only to look at the centerfold in public: a story about why I'm a creep.
07/10/2013 19:03 @bricksii :( :( :( but I bet if you tried you'd pick it back up really quickly!
07/10/2013 18:50 yuck
07/10/2013 18:50 and it's all warm in here. like an incubator for nerd funk and disease
07/10/2013 18:50 dude in the CS lab is extra sick
07/10/2013 18:46 I am extra spoiled by python tho
07/10/2013 18:45 I don't know about you but personally I think programming in C is difficult.
07/10/2013 18:40 @bricksii yeah dude n-queens was extra hard especially when we were like "oh hey what is C"
07/10/2013 18:39 whaaaaat CS 241's lab 4 is n queens?!?!! that was our first lab!!! outraged
07/10/2013 18:24 talk was given by Cynthia's... gentleman friend?
07/10/2013 18:24 pizza talk was scary but v well done. I also had an opportunity to be smart and make Ben happy by "defining" information security
07/10/2013 18:22 @blaiddxdrwg precious babyyyy
07/10/2013 15:52 you can use their firmware to break out of a virtual machine!
07/10/2013 15:52 now for a pizza talk about hacking iSight cameras
07/10/2013 15:51 @bricksii I had a dream you gave me $100
07/10/2013 15:06 empty inbox
07/10/2013 15:05 my boss == best boss
06/10/2013 17:50 And of course now I am hungover and I do not want to get out of bed.
06/10/2013 17:47 It has taken 8 years of drinking too much to realize this.
06/10/2013 17:47 I feel like I accept misery as a small drawback of being very drunk. I could just be less drunk and not miserable.
06/10/2013 17:45 It has come to my attention that I should maybe drink less.
06/10/2013 17:45 Doing stupid things and saying embarrassing and offensive shit while drunk. The book. The movie. The life.
06/10/2013 03:03 Heh heh heh yeah
06/10/2013 02:42 Watched "weird science" b/c of @_Brendonsmall 's SE4E"curses" of home movies yes good
06/10/2013 01:03 I must have some chartreuse
06/10/2013 01:02 people are BARREL-AGING vodka red bulls with GREEN CHARTREUSE

06/10/2013 01:00 @blaiddxdrwg how about if I pet 'n' scratch you and bring over some cookies and beer how about that
06/10/2013 00:24 drinking p mediocre warm sake but it is delicious anyway b/c sake
06/10/2013 00:24 was going to make cookies. got distracted by article about polyamory on fb.

05/10/2013 19:41 shoes slightly squeezy on the toes but still qewt http://t.co/NOu75nFlpH
05/10/2013 19:38 ... so if you wanted to buy me a beer in exchange that is fine
05/10/2013 19:38 I just want it to go to a good home. the material is p cheap. comes with a belt. would run you no more than $30 retail ...
05/10/2013 19:37 the dress shape is a floppy sort of tube dress. it is very short but does not look good on short people. size M. shoot me a DM if interested
05/10/2013 19:36 this is the pattern on the dress. I like it a little? http://t.co/kkCThU2FA3
05/10/2013 19:34 mystery box contents: extremely sparkly stilettos with small platform. ugliest dress I have ever seen in my entire life.
05/10/2013 00:09 @zelukester @theDickUpBear be there soon!
04/10/2013 23:36 advice to ppl who might hit up Cowhaus this weekend: apple + honey/pecorino/walnut is the best
04/10/2013 20:47 All the benches outside are gone because of construction
04/10/2013 20:47 Oops at feve early
04/10/2013 20:38 @theDickUpBear @vomeronasal @zelukester @Slotheye yeeees
04/10/2013 18:40 mystery garment, mystery shoes. I want to know what they are.
04/10/2013 18:40 I bought a mystery thing from modcloth. why can't it be here yet.
04/10/2013 18:37 somebody give me a fucking medal I got bloodwork done today
04/10/2013 17:48 I can't believe it. I'm bored! how did that happen?
04/10/2013 17:48 @theDickUpBear hey let's "do some math" together
04/10/2013 00:45 @yak_dad @minjalinjee (I am sure it was lovely)
04/10/2013 00:45 @yak_dad @minjalinjee gross I am like the only SW Ohioan who hates Skyline
03/10/2013 17:40 I am loaning a CS dude my stick blender so maybe he will accept me
03/10/2013 17:40 @blaiddxdrwg yes accurate
03/10/2013 17:36 long island night: never forget. always regret.
03/10/2013 17:35 too hungover :(
03/10/2013 02:04 Ssssaaaaffffeeeettttyyyy safety! dance!
03/10/2013 02:03 I love the safety dance omg
03/10/2013 01:40 what a productive week it has been so far. I have really been on a roll since Saturday. go nif go
02/10/2013 23:00 Can someone let me into north the door is not working
02/10/2013 20:27 @blaiddxdrwg wow rude
02/10/2013 15:49 @blaiddxdrwg idk fb just keeps putting these ads up. maybe if you talk about how much you like vodka in ur status u'll get targeted adverts
02/10/2013 05:31 what do I know anyway
02/10/2013 05:31 w/e
02/10/2013 05:31 or speaking from a place of relative privilege that isn't ever acknowledged and leads to just straight-up being wrong
02/10/2013 05:31 by poorly I mean "without correct info"
02/10/2013 05:30 :sigh: people I really like commenting poorly on the ACA but yet I don't know enough to correct them
02/10/2013 05:21 fb wants me to be a hype girl for a liquor company. if I weren't in school I'd do it in a heartbeat.
02/10/2013 05:15 @klaauser I pay $600/mo for ONE of my medications. that is most certainly more than I pay for rent. idk man preach it
02/10/2013 00:36 @Slotheye @donnerhai dude vampire gloves rule
01/10/2013 16:38 @theDickUpBear ohhhhhhhh I totally would tho. want to just walk over there and get some take out? kinda missing the point but still good
01/10/2013 16:37 @theDickUpBear where at? am currently in downstairs lab. have lab helping at 1
01/10/2013 16:31 sobbing b/c so many people filled out the snackboard survey thank you so much @BvBunny we got like 20 responses in &lt; 24 hours
01/10/2013 16:27 that's actually incorrect. I would eat only recreationally if I could.
01/10/2013 16:27 I love food but I hate eating
01/10/2013 16:27 eating is inconvenient
01/10/2013 16:26 "I don't know why I drank so much PBR! Just because it's free doesn't make it taste better." "That's where you're wrong." CS 151 grading
01/10/2013 16:25 but I mean like I bet those (bourbon) manhattans tasted way better than PBR
01/10/2013 16:24 apparently senior night was last night and I could have had free beer instead of making a billion manhattans at home???
01/10/2013 16:24 Showed up for grader meeting hungover. other two graders also hungover.
01/10/2013 16:13 @ettrix :cries softly:
01/10/2013 02:49 @HuhRadio meet me on hall sometime soon, I have your shirt.
01/10/2013 02:49 @Slotheye on hall now! See you anytime
30/09/2013 23:58 what an alright day. everything works out for the best after all. now I am drinking.
30/09/2013 23:46 @BvBunny see prev
30/09/2013 23:46 love how the guy who agreed to design the survey for our HCI project and straight-up didn't do it had the most criticisms on my survey
30/09/2013 19:14 actively slacking off :)
30/09/2013 15:58 This week is going to be fine.
30/09/2013 15:22 also before you use your print quota, please notice that both printers in the library are down.
30/09/2013 15:21 basically I just got a free pass on last week's assignment. woop! maybe I can finish it today!
30/09/2013 15:20 best research advisor ben kuperman
30/09/2013 15:20 received a response minutes after his class got out: "...we were meeting today??"
30/09/2013 15:19 had to email research advisor in a panic like "SORRY WE CAN'T MEET TODAY I'M SORRY"
30/09/2013 15:19 remember how I said I was going to fall asleep in front of my computer? yeah. woke up at 4 to see my ssh session had timed out.
30/09/2013 15:16 @lemmerly the counseling center is prohibitively far away for people who might have trouble getting out of bed. &gt;:(
30/09/2013 04:57 I'm considering a 5hr energy for a little extra pep. might be an all-nighter tonight b/c I am irresponsible.
30/09/2013 04:56 it's going to be one of those nights where I fall asleep in front of my computer.
30/09/2013 04:55 so much work to do still :(
30/09/2013 01:04 @HuhRadio when r u leaving I have that Stoli t-shirt to give to you
30/09/2013 00:53 @magnetochron it's not my jam, really. like I wouldn't wear it? but that doesn't mean it's not cool, ya know?
29/09/2013 23:14 @zombielynx21 thank you. :) (also your haircut looks great)
29/09/2013 22:55 but now poico!
29/09/2013 22:55 I don't mean to be shitty, I'm just not really in control of myself sometimes. I understand that's no excuse, but still.
29/09/2013 22:54 I have been cycling really hard and have been in the midst of a pretty powerful episode for the past few days.
29/09/2013 22:54 I feel like I've been a real shitbag to everyone and I am sorry for that.
29/09/2013 22:54 @magnetochron I'm personally not into leggings-as-pants unless you're working out or something
28/09/2013 04:55 @jwisser oh noooo
28/09/2013 04:52 i feel like a bad child
28/09/2013 04:51 auuuuugh I know I care massively about this programming contest but whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy do I have to go to bed
28/09/2013 04:44 RT @cat_beltane: If it's all right i'd like to keep calling it a "computer" even tho i'm using it less 4 turing-style calculations and more…
28/09/2013 00:54 @locuscoeruleus nvm I read
28/09/2013 00:54 @locuscoeruleus oh
28/09/2013 00:53 @locuscoeruleus ??????
27/09/2013 22:20 Aries??????!!!!!!!! Is at the feve????!!!!!!
27/09/2013 22:20 Singing "ommegang Hennepin" like the pokemon pikachu tamagotchi jingle
27/09/2013 19:22 nearly throwing up with excitement about competitive programming omg
27/09/2013 18:40 (with the help of 5hr energy of course)
27/09/2013 18:37 wow feeling a bunch more confident now. imagine doing these problems with another person! in four hours! I can do this.
27/09/2013 18:21 I am KILLING these competitive programming problems
27/09/2013 17:25 I am a competent cook, if not a better one, while under the influence.
27/09/2013 17:21 unfortunately one of those tasks has like 12 subtasks so you know
27/09/2013 17:20 I have 3 things left on my to-do list :) :) :)
27/09/2013 16:52 maybe I'll take a break and do that once I'm done with this HCI paper writeup
27/09/2013 16:51 I should, like, contribute to the coffee fund and maybe clean the coffee maker sometime.
27/09/2013 16:51 habits: bringing a mason jar full of ground coffee to the CS lab, making a full pot, drinking the whole thing.
27/09/2013 16:21 don't mind me
27/09/2013 16:21 are you /fucking/ kidding me. actually tho. that is a fucking outrage. #vaguetweeting
27/09/2013 16:12 @Panahinuva we're geniuses. I'm making this for a brunch party sometime.
27/09/2013 16:11 @Panahinuva ... coca cola reduction, LONG ISLAND FRUIT SALAD
27/09/2013 16:11 @Panahinuva you just gave me a great idea: gin oranges, vodka watermelons, rum cantaloupe, tequila strawberries, a li'l lemon juice, ...
27/09/2013 15:58 (it's for science)
27/09/2013 15:57 I should download foursquare
27/09/2013 15:55 worrying about developing some sort of dementia several decades from now instead of reading about software design: the niftynif story
27/09/2013 15:44 @jwisser no that's okay I've been thinking that all week
27/09/2013 15:43 I need to close twitter probably so I can read this paper on ~the diversification of participatory HCI~
27/09/2013 15:42 @TheBardofNight :grumbles:
27/09/2013 15:41 now's the time to cycle I guess. might as well. gotta do competitive programming tomorrow anyway and (hypo)mania will only help.
27/09/2013 15:39 I am being a little grandiose this has implications for my mood
27/09/2013 15:39 it wouldn't be terribly difficult also what is ~art~
27/09/2013 15:38 probabilistic models there, just throw everything at it. hard code some rules for humor. truncate tweets for max hilarity. I can write that.
27/09/2013 15:37 like, horse_ebooks was pretty consistently funny when it was people, but I bet I can do it better. a little part of speech tagging here, ...
27/09/2013 15:36 for my NLP final project I want to automate what horse_ebooks was doing by hand but do it even better.
27/09/2013 15:31 @jwisser not sure, I think all the sleeping spaces are taken up in our house for the weekend b/c everyone is visiting!
27/09/2013 15:29 "If you don't know where the stapler is, you're not a real CS major."
27/09/2013 15:27 @Panahinuva best fruit salad ever?
27/09/2013 15:25 @TheBardofNight if you find yourself in King with a coffee cup in the next hour or so, stop by 135, I can hook you up.
27/09/2013 15:24 @TheBardofNight I am in the CS lab where there is a large-capacity coffee maker. there might be a bit in the fridge but probs not much
27/09/2013 15:23 put bourbon in my cider also!
27/09/2013 15:23 :screams: I'm going to infuse bourbon with apples!
27/09/2013 15:22 coffee for breakfast coffee for lunch coffee for every meal and then I get really drunk at happy hour the end
27/09/2013 15:21 @Slotheye I almost made stretch/porno noises in the CS lab, but then looked around real quick to make sure nobody was in here.
27/09/2013 15:17 -50, no points for you.
27/09/2013 15:17 I want to grade your lab with a fucking script, not suffer through digging around in this nested mess of folders you decided were necessary.
27/09/2013 15:17 also the Eclipse circus. my god. just follow the fucking instructions. I know Eclipse sucks but it's not that hard to use.
27/09/2013 15:15 fell asleep while trying to grade the shitshow that is "CS 151: so about all that Python you learned? ha ha...hahaha...ahahahahAHAHAHAHAHA"
27/09/2013 15:11 @donnerhai @blaiddxdrwg @JamieisPerf @yak_dad @aDoctorMoon THE NEW ERA OF POP TART SANDWICHES IS UPON US
27/09/2013 05:34 @JamieisPerf @yak_dad @aDoctorMoon ohhhhhhhhh those are soooooo goooooood
27/09/2013 05:26 especially Ben and Tom, they really have my back
27/09/2013 05:25 I love how I'm such a shitty student but all the professors in my department are willing to give me a chance.
27/09/2013 05:20 you can't eat potato chips with one hand
27/09/2013 05:19 cheese is just one food you don't eat off the floor.
27/09/2013 05:09 the work is going nowhere.
27/09/2013 05:07 @yak_dad I've gotten away from fruit flavored pop tarts lately. I go for the ultra sweet flavors like smores.
27/09/2013 05:07 it took me a literal eternity to catch up on twitter.
27/09/2013 05:07 oh god I thought I didn't want pop tarts. why would I ever think that. I always want pop tarts.
26/09/2013 23:12 @magnetochron god I hope so. I'm so into flatforms.
26/09/2013 18:48 @donnerhai that would work too
26/09/2013 18:47 the crushing amounts of work never stop.
26/09/2013 18:46 RT @crylenol: Commercial for Twitter dot com:  *man yells nonsense out his window*  Narrator: Don't you wish there were a better way?
26/09/2013 18:39 @bricksii food is optional. also, chocolate is totally food anyway.
26/09/2013 18:16 to do: math hw, XenLabs fixes, groceries and meds, grading, worksheet, reading, laundry, study for programming contest
26/09/2013 18:12 lunch calibrated for maximum energy: doubleshot, sugar-free rockstar, caffeinated protein bar, chocolate.
26/09/2013 18:00 @blaiddxdrwg it was the best possible email scenario: an extension on an assignment
26/09/2013 05:58 Reading emails from your professor at 1:30 AM, no matter how sober you are: feels really bad
26/09/2013 00:39 I knew that quad espresso was a good idea
26/09/2013 00:38 ah yes you know it's school when heart palpitations
25/09/2013 21:52 mmmmmm satisfying programming
25/09/2013 20:57 @HuhRadio I'm dying because "tobaco fuzz"
25/09/2013 20:55 @theDickUpBear @vomeronasal I'm totally down--just cancelled poico in favor of lots and lots of work
25/09/2013 18:22 @theDickUpBear @vomeronasal @TheBardofNight I have poico at 7, but I can swing by after depending on where you are! (8:30)
25/09/2013 18:21 fuuuuck
25/09/2013 18:21 one team has these 3 CS dudebros who are all good friends and p smart, my team has 2 ppl incl me and a complete stranger.
25/09/2013 18:20 I feel like I'm being set up to fail on this programming contest thing.
25/09/2013 18:15 @picardspajamas technically no, but it can be done. you just need to ask resed nicely (@theDickUpBear may have advice on the matter)
25/09/2013 18:12 I want an egg and some toast
25/09/2013 17:11 NLP is groovy
25/09/2013 17:10 holy balls this shit is like magic. changed the way my program was handling probabilities and suddenly it's a kajillion times more effective
25/09/2013 17:01 I'm actually drinking water. someone should give me a medal.
25/09/2013 16:40 special thx to @theDickUpBear who was sweet enough to get me to actually start my day this morning b/c I don't live with my parents anymore
25/09/2013 16:38 (just kidding)
25/09/2013 16:38 fuck the user, man
25/09/2013 16:38 like I have to basically change every part of the system I worked on this summer because it is not user-friendly
25/09/2013 16:37 all I can think about is how much work I have to finish by the end of the week.  It's mind-crushing.
25/09/2013 14:39 I have to go to therapy today :(
25/09/2013 14:36 it's going to be really nice out all weekend and I'm spending Saturday at a programming contest.
25/09/2013 14:33 profoundly angered by this lab assignment that is due soon that I might have to start over.
25/09/2013 14:11 @BvBunny I can't with these. probably funnier than the trial itself which I did not see
25/09/2013 04:52 (secret tweet: I have extraordinary knowledge)
25/09/2013 04:49 goodnight
25/09/2013 04:49 it is my goddamn bedtime
25/09/2013 04:48 some of these people in my gmail contacts list could suck a fuck
25/09/2013 04:47 @HuhRadio sadness fortress
25/09/2013 04:47 that is the thing I want is tattoos of food. I'll be percolating on this.  Better start saving.
25/09/2013 04:46 tattoos of food
25/09/2013 04:46 tattoos I want: sleeve of fruits. sleeve of vegetables. sleeve of fruits and/or vegetables.
25/09/2013 04:46 where is the livestream of #hva2013 ???
25/09/2013 02:48 THE 1928 SHOEGLAZE INDIE BBQ CHAMPS WIN
25/09/2013 02:28 @TheBardofNight @zelukester is on board
25/09/2013 02:28 @TheBardofNight tooch?!?!!!?!
25/09/2013 02:20 @zombielynx21 yeeeesss, I have had this similar thought recently this week
25/09/2013 01:57 @Tantoes_: "Herding?" But Corgis' legs are so short, they'd just fall over!; Blair: hey FUCK OFF
25/09/2013 01:29 @theDickUpBear you mentioned "Rock Me Amadeus" recently and I remembered the artist and it was a trivia question &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
25/09/2013 01:12 RT @HuhRadio: Why be modest when you can be honest?
24/09/2013 23:22 @BvBunny I mean it's a great department but like CS is haaaard
24/09/2013 23:22 @BvBunny it's a bad scene in there, the CS department
24/09/2013 22:55 not /necessarily/ because I'm a dumb slacker, but because the seamonster after I took CS 150 was when I started having problems w/my brain.
24/09/2013 22:55 an A in my major! I haven't gotten one of those since I took CS150!
24/09/2013 22:54 but this bodes ultra-well: I can totally get an A in this class.
24/09/2013 22:54 :wails: I have an 87% in HCI b/c I missed class like once. I wish Cynthia wouldn't post our grades on blackboard so early in the seamonster.
24/09/2013 22:52 ****the more you know
24/09/2013 22:52 TIL: "perquisite" is not just a bastardization of "prerequisite" but an actual word.
24/09/2013 22:44 now wandering about aimlessly because I don't want to do any work on this lab because I feel like I'll just end up undoing everything.
24/09/2013 22:31 in other news, I managed to not say "P = NP deadline" when the P/NP deadline was mentioned. ... ... ... damn it...
24/09/2013 22:28 what I'm saying is this professor sucks.
24/09/2013 22:28 ...and also wait for you to actually tell us what we need to do.
24/09/2013 22:28 because we need to go back and fix all of these things we didn't account for because you didn't put them in the instructions...
24/09/2013 22:27 because there are instructions missing in the lab we get a 14 hour extension but we are minus more than one day on work time.
24/09/2013 22:27 what you're saying is you're giving us an extension but we can't work on the lab until after class tomorrow when you will have explained it
24/09/2013 16:30 hnnnnng http://t.co/cWQEhBMTRp
24/09/2013 00:50 she wants the (python builtin) d(ictionary class)
24/09/2013 00:00 crushing amts of work compounded by the crushing failure of today
23/09/2013 21:23 @vomeronasal oof, all of my work is lab-type work today. :( otherwise I'd be there.
23/09/2013 21:22 this week is gonna be better than last week I swear
23/09/2013 20:26 at least I paid the internet bill
23/09/2013 19:13 Consoling myself with taco bell because THE TACO BELL IN AMHERST IS OPEN AGAIN
23/09/2013 18:42 what a fucking disaster
23/09/2013 18:41 wow I guess I'm not going to class today at all
23/09/2013 05:31 this week is a new week. time to get to sleep so I can work hard tomorrow.
23/09/2013 04:11 really into the @TacoBell homecoming proposals
22/09/2013 21:06 this is awFUL
22/09/2013 21:06 okay so WHY are only SOME OF US teaching 3 HOURS OF EXCO every week
22/09/2013 21:05 @bricksii I agree!
22/09/2013 20:14 WOOOOOO
22/09/2013 20:14 gonna work hard and not do drugs
22/09/2013 20:14 shit to do! gonna get this week started hell of correctly
22/09/2013 20:13 I drank a 5-hr energy because it's Sunday and I need energy for a Sunday
22/09/2013 20:09 @horrorwine a special someone in my life needs this also
22/09/2013 20:08 @bricksii we talked about the lack of skeuomorphism in iOS 7 in class on Friday! interesting discussion on the changing nature of computing.
20/09/2013 20:34 @magnetochron np! :D
20/09/2013 20:33 @magnetochron but there's a world of difference between actual science terms and "bipolar ohio weather amirite?"
20/09/2013 20:33 @magnetochron no I don't think so, I mean in like physics and stuff? yeah, I think that's totally legit.
20/09/2013 20:30 all in all today turned out
20/09/2013 20:30 disclaimer after disclaimer after disclaimer
20/09/2013 20:30 I say "my condition" like I'm the only one. you know what I mean. it's for the greater good.
20/09/2013 20:29 like I know there exist other, prolly more pressing issues in the world, but I'm not gonna let ppl spread misunderstanding abt my condition
20/09/2013 20:28 sorry broski no amt of undergrad ab psych classes qualify you to call the weather "bipolar"
20/09/2013 20:28 SNACKBOARD
20/09/2013 19:05 http://t.co/umhsEazp2g this is hysterical and relevant to my class discussion in 25 minutes
20/09/2013 19:02 Whoa nobody told me the Sharxler baby was named Declan
20/09/2013 18:57 @magnetochron ooh, I don't know anything about that! that gives me a great excuse to scour the cookie file for memories.
20/09/2013 18:52 while I hate to break CS tradition, I'm glad someone took the stapler out of that nasty-ass fridge.
20/09/2013 18:08 this paper says I need to "restructure the perception of reality" uh okay
20/09/2013 17:25 @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight @vomeronasal necessarily
20/09/2013 00:53 @cureGore &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 congrats :)
19/09/2013 18:30 I need a food
19/09/2013 17:04 furiously clicking on tabs to avoid work
18/09/2013 22:40 @vomeronasal eep. :( poico is tonight, but maybe after?
18/09/2013 01:22 @jwisser yes okay
18/09/2013 01:21 I think my food ideas are getting a little out of control
18/09/2013 01:21 I want to deep-fry shiitakes and have them melt in my mouth
18/09/2013 01:18 I want to make a soup out of potato chips. that's some molecular gastronomy shit right there.
18/09/2013 00:34 @BvBunny if it's for hci, it's because the paper makes literally 0 sense.
17/09/2013 23:46 @jwisser oh me toŏo. I sympathize.
17/09/2013 23:38 the article in that link claims to be ~7000 words long btw
17/09/2013 23:37 http://t.co/lAsYCxjyNN seriously
17/09/2013 23:37 @jwisser I spose that's kinda close...but I also want to make it myself!
17/09/2013 23:33 I want non-instant ramen
17/09/2013 23:33 ramen week on Serious Eats is KILLING ME
17/09/2013 16:53 @magnetochron makeup expiration dates are bullshit. if I spent more than $10 on it, then I am going to keep it until it runs out, damn it.
17/09/2013 02:39 one of my FRIENDS from HIGH SCHOOL has an ECONOMICS BLOG. how cool is that?!
17/09/2013 02:12 @jwisser I think part of the problem is that the exco committee is made exclusively of people who don't want to be on the exco committee.
17/09/2013 02:05 3 hours of class (? this is disputed but I was explicitly told this by a committee member) + no more 0 credit option
17/09/2013 02:04 the new exco system basically removes all accountability from students and forces it all on the instructors.
17/09/2013 02:01 man sssssssssssssss: no manual page for sssssssssssssss found
17/09/2013 02:01 hissing at my computer by typing "sssssssssssssss" into the terminal
17/09/2013 02:01 report achievement to research advisor. find out 10 minutes later that you didn't actually do what you thought you did and everything is bad
16/09/2013 22:20 @TheLoosha it really is quite tedious. I'm not sure what I was expecting.
16/09/2013 22:12 @TheLoosha I had to identify people in their linkedin/fb/twitter/github/etc profiles and see if two profiles were of the same person.
16/09/2013 21:58 tried "turking" for the first time (not to be confused with "twerking"). definitely not as cool as I expected it to be.
16/09/2013 18:59 I am freaking out over this
16/09/2013 18:59 like "oh, you see free food? where is it? oh maybe it's RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING"
16/09/2013 18:59 maybe I can. someone in our group has an iOS license+android experience so we can make an app that USES YOUR GPS TO KEEP TRACK OF FREE FOOD
16/09/2013 18:57 I have excitements about HCI but I cannot realize them

16/09/2013 14:25 tortilla chips: breakfast of champions
16/09/2013 14:20 I would go to my lab but I'm drinking this coffee in the downstairs lab and I can't take it all with me ;~;
16/09/2013 14:18 like I'd go now and turn in the rent myself but our asshole neighbors parked me in.
16/09/2013 14:17 stressin out because I don't have my todo list with me and maybe we forgot to pay the rent this morning and aaaaAAAAAAA
16/09/2013 03:37 "I'm thirsty." "For the d?" "if the d stands for dihydrogen monoxide."
16/09/2013 01:56 mmmmmm
16/09/2013 01:56 au gratin apples FOR SURE
16/09/2013 01:56 twice-baked apples. mashed apples. apple bread. apple fries. apple chips.
16/09/2013 01:55 learn to cook by following this one crazy rule: you can substitute an apple for a potato in every instance.
16/09/2013 01:40 I'm going to read about breakfast tacos. just thought you should know.
16/09/2013 01:32 poptart sandwich: 1. spread something on a poptart 2. put a poptart on top of it 3. replace the shame you feel with getting high instead
16/09/2013 01:31 Poptart sandwich time!!!!!
16/09/2013 00:46 scissors are just two knives
15/09/2013 19:46 and wrote an email to my grandparents, and sent someone a fb message ... I really shouldn't sell myself short.
15/09/2013 19:45 picked up my computer to see my to-do list. have instead caught up on twatter, looked at some dresses on ModCloth, and posted a status to fb
15/09/2013 07:22 320 blaze itttttt
14/09/2013 23:59 if you know where to buy one in stores, hit me up
14/09/2013 23:57 I want a Left Hand "Week Sauce" (so named for Beer Week, for which it was designed). it's probably the porter I like most in the world.
14/09/2013 23:38 I have a prof that loses at preparedness. lab not posted, always backtracking and contradicting self in lectures. it's bad times at 9 AM
14/09/2013 23:33 I know I say things like "evench" for "eventually," but "margs" for "margaritas" is unacceptable.
14/09/2013 23:25 @theDickUpBear excuse you that's my house
14/09/2013 21:39 @horrorwine not like you needed to know all that or anything but hey I'm here to help
14/09/2013 21:37 @horrorwine but, ya know. he's a funny kid. if you meet him everything will become clear.
14/09/2013 21:32 @horrorwine I think now that he has a better community to hang out with (as opposed to living in Barrows) he's mellowed out a bit.
14/09/2013 21:31 @horrorwine he's a little awkward and socially weird. he used to follow me around. but he's okay, he's an okay guy.
14/09/2013 21:23 sorry, I'm not going to take 30 seconds to pour a beer "properly" that is too long and I want beer http://t.co/BDuWvAm2vQ
14/09/2013 19:34 I'd be a theme park nerd if I had $ to travel, but for now I'll settle for being a sort of second-rate WDW nerd.
14/09/2013 19:33 still talking about cedar point
14/09/2013 19:32 also the pass that includes all the good rides costs over $100 IN ADDITION TO your ticket price. :cries:
14/09/2013 19:31 ride them in a timely fashion that is
14/09/2013 19:31 fast lane passes are a real racket. they took dragster and gatekeeper off the fast lane circuit and now you have to spend more money to ride
14/09/2013 19:30 I was thinking I'd go in October
14/09/2013 19:30 does anyone want to go to cedar point with me for halloweekends or whatever it's called

13/09/2013 16:58 fuck today already I guess
13/09/2013 16:56 I am just a weight-gain machine
13/09/2013 16:55 but like no wonder none of my clothes fit I bought them all when I was 25 lbs smaller
13/09/2013 16:55 this is news to me.
13/09/2013 16:54 apparently I weigh 150 lbs
13/09/2013 16:50 @theDickUpBear @Tantoes_ @nautilimeyer @TheBardofNight Sounds good to me
13/09/2013 02:10 culinary genius: got high and made a pb&amp;b sandwich out of pop-tarts

12/09/2013 20:50 so much to do
12/09/2013 20:50 cannot..start up...today
12/09/2013 20:49 @FleetingMadness @CannedNirvana I'm tempted, but v tired and busy
12/09/2013 17:23 I was going to get lunch but now it's raining :(
12/09/2013 16:06 well after our chairs got taken, that is.
12/09/2013 16:05 that was last night
12/09/2013 16:05 :sigh: getting irrationally angry at people who are just trying to do their job and then having to confront deep-seated personal issues
12/09/2013 03:54 Douchebag and douchebag friends
11/09/2013 19:25 considering how I act around people in the department when I'm drunk I think going would be a TERRIBLE IDEA #alien8thedepartment
11/09/2013 19:25 lol I just got an invitation to a CS party
11/09/2013 19:23 I want to go home (for like a week)
11/09/2013 19:22 I'm going to do it I'm going to switch back to caffeine pills no egrets
11/09/2013 19:21 @yak_dad it's the champagne of beers! @Tantoes_
11/09/2013 19:21 @yak_dad god damn it I knew I had gotten something wrong here
11/09/2013 19:20 it would be more cost-effective to switch to caffeine pills though.
11/09/2013 19:20 I finally took the advice of the 5hr energy commercials and started taking them in the afternoon. best decision ever.
11/09/2013 19:19 I have so much directionless fury
11/09/2013 16:36 @theDickUpBear I was walking around outside when it happened and it filled me with despair :(
11/09/2013 14:56 source: internets
11/09/2013 14:55 p sure "aspirin" was a correct answer to the relevant trivia question last night. WE WERE ROBBED.
11/09/2013 14:52 @BvBunny "2010 Shoeglaze Indie BBQ Champions"
11/09/2013 14:51 @BvBunny all I can think of are really cumbersome names, like "Fighting Narwhals Co-Ed Interscholastic Curling Team"
11/09/2013 14:50 quick! @BvBunny and I need a "team name" for our project group!
11/09/2013 14:40 today in the lab: ResEd and OSCA are full of shit; killing people with STDs; what "et al." is for.
11/09/2013 14:38 "how did you even become the DLEC for a co-op that doesn't have meetings?" trust me, BBC has meetings.
11/09/2013 14:36 @picardspajamas I go to CVS fairly often so maybe sometime I can give you a ride
11/09/2013 14:36 @picardspajamas never buy anything at Gibson's. generic is cetirizine but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't there.
11/09/2013 14:33 fuck today already
11/09/2013 14:32 it's not as awful as I make it seem: these are things I already think anyway.
11/09/2013 14:31 my therapist has gotten into the habit of writing strongly negative statements on cards and giving them to me to think about. it blows.
11/09/2013 14:27 this lab smells like nerd funk--oh, wait...that's just me.
11/09/2013 14:17 @jwisser you know what's cheaper than marijuana? not sleeping.
11/09/2013 14:16 @picardspajamas @JamieisPerf @HuhRadio nooooo buy the generic
11/09/2013 14:15 seriously everything is easier with Excel
11/09/2013 14:14 listening to 2 people discuss a problem for algorithms. sounds like something I could solve with LINEAR PROGRAMMING
11/09/2013 14:09 and I have to go to therapy AND the counseling center today :explodes:
11/09/2013 14:08 I couldn't sleep last night because I was sweating too much ;~;
11/09/2013 14:03 in my defense the prof was not lecturing well or in a manner that was even remotely engaging
11/09/2013 14:02 actually fell asleep a little in class with my energy drink sitting in front of me
11/09/2013 14:02 I am so tired. fuuuuck this

11/09/2013 02:34 3 rubber bands is what nerd cred is worth
11/09/2013 00:08 @horrorwine @JonnyQuirke @minjalinjee my point is the results of this experiment could be extra depressing.
11/09/2013 00:08 @horrorwine @JonnyQuirke @minjalinjee I was born in 1990 and I didn't make it to R/B in time, anyway! my first was Y.
11/09/2013 00:06 if I had a band I would name it DECLASS33E////// after something @theDickUpBear wrote on my tumblr this one time
10/09/2013 21:28 @yak_dad this one time, in Harkness, Finn made onion special meal. guess who was his prep cook.
10/09/2013 21:26 classmate says hello, I say, "YES WHAT" "..." "oh sorry hi I thought you were asking me a question and gnskdflgjdflbjf..."
10/09/2013 21:25 @magnetochron aha, I see. yeah, there are definitely a few kids who do not know what is going on.
10/09/2013 21:08 I understand that almost all of them have never used Java and the concept of curly braces is new and exciting, but augh
10/09/2013 21:07 I suspect that many of these people in CS151 have never programmed before.
10/09/2013 21:07 "so args.length == 1 means they put in the number 1, right?" oh, oh dear. why does this have to happen.
10/09/2013 21:06 "so you're saying I have to put 'public static void main(String[] args)' /every time/???" oh dear. it's going to be a long semester
10/09/2013 18:20 @theDickUpBear @Tantoes_ @nifty_nif @nautilimeyer yeeeesss

09/09/2013 18:13 @jwisser :D true
09/09/2013 18:13 @jwisser but like I mean you can figure out one from doing the other probably if you're using the same toolstack or whatever
09/09/2013 18:12 @jwisser ah, yeah, personal VMs. they probably mean server-type VMs, huh?
09/09/2013 18:06 my experience configuring VMs might be a huge plus when applying to things??!?!

09/09/2013 14:51 @jwisser there's also this god cycle, it would seem, of these enchantments that turn into creatures when you are appropriately "devoted"
09/09/2013 14:50 @jwisser I mean there's a mechanic called "devotion"
09/09/2013 14:49 @jwisser it is sort of artificial ancient Greek flavoring tho
09/09/2013 14:49 @jwisser T. yeah. this block is all about gods and such, it would seem.
09/09/2013 14:47 @jwisser still looks like a good time tho
09/09/2013 14:47 @jwisser I mean I'm just kinda scanning it. I don't play enough anymore to ID any real failures of cards but the flavor doesn't appeal to me
09/09/2013 14:45 reads Theros spoiler; is strangely titillated and disgusted
09/09/2013 14:41 @blaiddxdrwg it is truly baffling

07/09/2013 18:38 and THEN I introduced myself to A+ Neighbor Mooch who gave me a shot of nice vodka.
07/09/2013 18:38 luckily I backed out of that situation before it got extra weird
07/09/2013 18:37 sorry Oren. I'm a douchebag when I've had a few drinks. I know you did not want to spend your Friday night talking about CS journals with me
07/09/2013 18:36 So I think I browned out at the Feve while talking to someone in my department who already finds me creepy and weird
07/09/2013 18:21 @CrashCourseCafe :D thanks muchly!

06/09/2013 14:08 why the fuck did I decide to schedule the class around the participants' individual schedules?????????

06/09/2013 14:00 @jwisser good on you! I really should up my password game. I didn't mean to lecture at you. you know the score.
06/09/2013 13:58 @donnerhai I'm a huge fan of "biologiçt" and you should use it always
06/09/2013 13:57 @jwisser needless to say I have...no passwords like that
06/09/2013 13:57 @jwisser the best passwords are stupid-long, contain non-alphanumeric characters, and contain no dictionary words :( :( :(
06/09/2013 04:00 I think I'm coming down with a cold. better stay up late and eat pop tarts and go drink a lot tomorrow
06/09/2013 03:56 @have_a_hammer riiiight?! yeah it was yesterday.
06/09/2013 03:55 reading zazzlepoetry and trying to hold my shit together
06/09/2013 03:55 @have_a_hammer PoiCo! yeah and also the exco fair was really poorly advertised so nobody showed up
06/09/2013 03:27 @have_a_hammer I have to go into overload-mode to teach an exco &gt;:(
05/09/2013 23:41 @yak_dad oh my you need to own that
05/09/2013 23:40 @jwisser greeeeeaaat :(
05/09/2013 21:32 @jwisser I am slightly afraid to
05/09/2013 20:38 @jwisser :frowns deeply:
05/09/2013 17:27 "it doesn't work" "did you save it?" "...no"
05/09/2013 17:13 now I remember: everyone I'm going to TA is gonna have to learn Java whyyyy
05/09/2013 17:13 ugh this class is being taught in Python AGAIN
05/09/2013 17:11 everyone who is helping out this lab is really, really excitable and is reading the lab instructions each time someone new walks in
05/09/2013 17:09 it's actually not that bad this time around
05/09/2013 17:08 "WHERE IS MY PASSWORD" "NOTHING IS TYPING" "I CAN'T TYPE ANYTHING" "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
05/09/2013 17:08 so glad I'm doing 151 this seamonster

02/09/2013 19:50 we got an email yesterday from them saying they would send us an email today
02/09/2013 19:50 obviously I can figure it out but like the point still stands that the exco committee could suck slightly less sometimes
02/09/2013 19:49 "once you have reserved a time and place for your exco" HOW DO I DO THAT
02/09/2013 19:49 "fill out this form we have shared with you" NO YOU HAVE NOT
02/09/2013 19:49 okay fuck the exco committee

01/09/2013 18:25 (On the name Alec): you don't like watching spin-off tv...so why would you want a spin-off name?
01/09/2013 13:19 not a real punch, but last-minute HOLY SHIT THERE ARE 567 PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE punch
01/09/2013 13:19 I think I finished 3 or 4 bottles of alcohol last night making sour-type punch
01/09/2013 13:12 I would love just one spatial awareness
01/09/2013 13:12 being clumsy is butts

01/09/2013 01:16 @jwisser appreciated :D
01/09/2013 01:15 @jwisser I feel like I'm one of the few food enthusiasts who is repulsed by cold soup
01/09/2013 01:14 @jwisser icky
01/09/2013 01:11 I want soup even though it's meltingly hot inside
31/08/2013 23:14 I SWEAR I know which way they actually go I just look at them in the mirror all the time
31/08/2013 23:14 drew "visual biography" of self for work, accidentally drew tattoos backwards
31/08/2013 23:13 too many obligations, seems bad
31/08/2013 23:13 I am afraid of school
31/08/2013 23:08 nothing makes me feel fuzzier inside than an empty inbox :D
31/08/2013 22:02 like the actual minimum number of credits is equal to 3.5 classes so I can take a 2 credit private reading without penalty????
31/08/2013 22:00 ... I only have to take 14 credits???
31/08/2013 13:41 @picardspajamas you probably should in case. I am going to risk it and just bring a pen. They probably have handouts.
31/08/2013 13:40 @picardspajamas probably? maybe like something to write in?
31/08/2013 13:33 @picardspajamas ugh tell me about it

29/08/2013 22:34 oh no my "lifestyle tumblr" queue is empty
29/08/2013 22:20 currently braising taco meat with beer. this is the way to do it. minimal effort, maximum beer-type-taste.
29/08/2013 22:17 it's taco night at the satellite.
29/08/2013 22:15 also b/c my mom is afraid of most things, she is afraid of gambling.
29/08/2013 22:15 holy dicks. my parents are going to Las Vegas for the weekend. they never do shit like this ever.
28/08/2013 12:05 I want to wash my hair so I can go back to sleep
28/08/2013 12:00 in retrospect
28/08/2013 12:00 in retrospect drinking throughout Funny Games was a bad idea
28/08/2013 12:00 in retrospect watching Funny Games before bed was a bad idea
28/08/2013 11:52 I know I tweet that like every day but ya know. I never stop being hungover.
28/08/2013 11:52 being hungover is the worst.
28/08/2013 11:41 hair currently processing.
28/08/2013 11:41 I have to dye my hair before the freshbabies see me. they have to think I'm cool. I am very concerned about this.
28/08/2013 11:39 @LuciaAnneK the house is so creaky!! it's an issue.
28/08/2013 11:34 being a jerk and waking up your housemates because you can't sleep: another true and sad story.
28/08/2013 11:34 trying not to impulse-buy mason jars at walmart at 6 in the morning: a true and sad story
28/08/2013 11:33 :sighs heavily:
28/08/2013 11:33 I was drunk
28/08/2013 11:32 wow to amend a tweet of several hours ago I meant "shandy"
28/08/2013 02:44 goddammit amazon has us in a fucking chokehold
28/08/2013 02:07 @donnerhai !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No :(
28/08/2013 02:06 I was going to dye my hair tonight what happened--oh wait I got too drunk to drive to Walmart
28/08/2013 02:04 I am carefully picking the basil out of my shrub and eating it.
28/08/2013 02:02 @donnerhai who has the longest army
28/08/2013 01:57 Not b/c it's alliterative but b/c that's what I had sillies
28/08/2013 01:56 It's shrub shanty night again! Blackberry/basil/balsamic edition
28/08/2013 01:51 @Mondegreened cannot like this enough
27/08/2013 04:54 "Macho Self Whittle"
27/08/2013 04:54 "All of them Witches" it's an anagram! for, uh, "Cashew Motel Filth"
27/08/2013 03:05 @TheBardofNight not sure when tomorrow
27/08/2013 02:59 New frontiers in classiness: Johnnie Walker red on the rocks with "baby swiss" Cheez-its.
24/08/2013 05:09 I don't mean to say it is the ultimate movie, but it fits together perfectly and is very neat and satisfying.
24/08/2013 05:08 Layer Cake is probably a perfect movie. I do love a good movie about (dis)organized crime.
24/08/2013 05:07 does my exco have a syllabus
24/08/2013 05:07 holy christ the exco fair is positively looming

22/08/2013 21:19 @horrorwine @theDickUpBear he is but don't tell
22/08/2013 21:18 @horrorwine I learned all this from @theDickUpBear who is currently busy but can probably tell you more.
22/08/2013 21:17 @horrorwine @theDickUpBear Allegedly some of them may have taken drastic actions because of a documentary that "sunk their ship"
22/08/2013 21:17 @horrorwine @theDickUpBear some 1D fans are convinced that two members of the band (the p'manteau of their names being "Larry") are involved
22/08/2013 19:35 @blaiddxdrwg aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
22/08/2013 19:30 no but actually these puns are hysterical

20/08/2013 06:18 @zelukester people died, but I'm only 1/4 the way in, and it was only told from the present as a story from the past
20/08/2013 06:13 dip your pretzels in baileys. lifehack.
20/08/2013 06:12 @zelukester me either man. me either
20/08/2013 06:12 @zelukester which is said to be influenced strongly by hamlet? but it's been so long I don't know why
20/08/2013 06:11 @zelukester I'm reading Infinite Jest
20/08/2013 06:04 I need to read hamlet again this is important
20/08/2013 05:58 @Rookiss badass ukes unite

20/08/2013 01:47 drinks: "The Beach Episode"--1.5oz lt rum, .5oz peach schnapps, splash orange juice
19/08/2013 19:26 @magnetochron that's super advice. as it turns out, I did run into my worst enemy, too! but they were alone, so I didn't hear them snark.
19/08/2013 19:17 it was kind of a "throw on everything to overcompensate for lack of inspiration" day
19/08/2013 19:16 I think I'm just poorly dressed in general.
19/08/2013 19:16 it's one of those days where I feel like I accessorized badly.
19/08/2013 18:02 who's it for? it's for @theDickUpBear! http://t.co/xWQ6nkkVp1
19/08/2013 18:01 @donnerhai oh dude :( that sucks so much
19/08/2013 06:10 BATS ARE SCARY
19/08/2013 06:07 fffffFFFFFFFUUUUUUU we have BATS
19/08/2013 05:59 @Rookiss ...it's from true blood ;~;
19/08/2013 05:19 I am the KING OF LOUISIANA
19/08/2013 02:45 @nautilimeyer @theDickUpBear @LuciaAnneK okay let's one of us give them a call tomorrow and find out
19/08/2013 02:43 @nautilimeyer @theDickUpBear it might still be on Fridays for the summer? not sure if they've switched back yet @LuciaAnneK
19/08/2013 02:30 @smythekatelyn @HuhRadio I really need to up my game. I've been slacking.
19/08/2013 00:11 @zombielynx21 sshhhhh
18/08/2013 23:29 that just means I have to eat all of them :D :D :D :( :( :(
18/08/2013 23:22 so upon further consideration these jello shots taste strong but aren't super high in alcohol. :(
18/08/2013 20:40 and WOW they are strong. I donked up a little.
18/08/2013 20:39 I had to try the jello shots because I wanted to confirm their firmness
18/08/2013 20:29 you'll thank me later
18/08/2013 20:29 and several CO2 and N2O cartridges pls
18/08/2013 20:29 I NEED an iSi cream whipper
18/08/2013 20:16 why haven't I made soft pretzels yet? I'm really letting everyone down (paging @plaidplaidduck)
18/08/2013 20:14 no jello shots until after 7. no jello shots until after 7. no jello shots until after 7.
18/08/2013 20:13 my jello shots are getting there!!! man I hope they're the best.
18/08/2013 20:00 okay so would a conventional oven shelf support a 15 or 30 lb baking steel? I'm asking because pizza.
18/08/2013 19:57 @magnetochron @donnerhai it looks pretty intuitive, right? ah well.
18/08/2013 19:28 I feel a little bit self-conscious.
18/08/2013 19:28 I wonder what percentage of people pronounce Cynar like "sigh-nar"? It can't just be me who ignored the wikipedia pronunciation guide.
18/08/2013 19:23 revelation of the day: finding out how "Cynar" is actually pronounced.
18/08/2013 18:13 a delightful afternoon so far making jello shots and reading Infinite Jest on the porch with a cynar and soda.
18/08/2013 18:10 @plaidplaidduck I spent all summer ~hacking~ ;D Is that good enough? Maybe I'll downgrade my nemeses to enemies or rivals.
18/08/2013 16:33 @jwisser no, just left. :&lt;
18/08/2013 16:28 the feve home for wayward nemeses
18/08/2013 00:34 @locuscoeruleus @theDickUpBear oh necessarily
18/08/2013 00:32 @locuscoeruleus you really should ask @theDickUpBear he's better at that sort of thing.
18/08/2013 00:31 @locuscoeruleus oh my...I'd have to taste it to know what its name is, but it sounds splendid. I'm no good at those fancy cocktail names.
18/08/2013 00:07 how about we  -shitty and +alcohol
17/08/2013 21:03 on the plus side the new upstairs Feve is SO NICE
17/08/2013 21:03 it's shitty hangover day!!
15/08/2013 23:26 @jwisser I guess not. D:"
15/08/2013 23:21 what do you think actually happens when it rains, hm?
15/08/2013 23:21 this one doesn't even have sleeves
15/08/2013 23:19 while reading a slideshow about raincoats: "wow these are pretty" "..." "none of thEM HAVE HOODS"
15/08/2013 23:15 @Slotheye went back the next day and got a pixie cut.
15/08/2013 23:14 @Slotheye ...like a mushroom once
15/08/2013 23:14 @Slotheye oof. :( yeah. most of the time when my hair ended up like that it was because I did it myself but also my hairdresser made me look
15/08/2013 23:13 @Slotheye what I mean to say is "I've been there." :(
15/08/2013 23:12 @Slotheye did your hairdresser expect you to flat iron your hair every 5 minutes or
15/08/2013 13:23 @locuscoeruleus @donnerhai groovy! Let me know what you come up with.
15/08/2013 12:11 @locuscoeruleus those first two sound incredible. &gt;:D I have a mission...
15/08/2013 02:04 @lemmerly oof. :( really sorry to hear that.
15/08/2013 00:10 @queenfilmgeek look my tumblr is almost exclusively selfies so uh no shame
12/08/2013 02:46 @zelukester I feel like they went in a more mundane and not as cool or innovative direction this time around.
12/08/2013 02:46 @zelukester I mean it's fine...I just expect better! it's banal and not as punchy as their other stuff. doesn't stand up to Era Vulgaris. :(
12/08/2013 02:39 goddamn it this new QOTSA album totally sucks
12/08/2013 00:46 getting really excited about drinks I probably won't make.
12/08/2013 00:45 I want badly to make a Hurricane. there is a hurricane glass in this house. I must use it.
12/08/2013 00:44 improved one of @theDickUpBear's shots: Assblaster: .5oz apple schnapps (pref. cheap), 1.5oz aftershock cinnamon. top w/151 and set on fire
11/08/2013 23:56 @jwisser it wasn't, but it could have been.  &gt;:D
11/08/2013 03:59 which one is math? kitten? square root of 3? if you don't know, you don't get to see the video.
11/08/2013 03:58 the captchas for these episodes of The Newsroom ask the hard-hitting questions: which is hardest? holding a pen? staring at blank paper?
11/08/2013 00:23 @maayanplaut awesome! glad it worked out. :D the taste really changes over time.
10/08/2013 23:04 today's dinner is leftover home fries from almost a week ago
10/08/2013 22:51 @locuscoeruleus hell yeah. I'd drink it.
10/08/2013 22:28 @locuscoeruleus also lemons and ginger will make you feel better maybe or something OKAY I'M DONE SORRY EVERYONE
10/08/2013 22:27 @locuscoeruleus throw in a little ginger simple syrup... I'm getting excited about this. too bad I have no alcohol.
10/08/2013 22:26 @locuscoeruleus and a strawberry likes black pepper so idk. another suggestion would be to make a cute rhubarb tom collins bc it is failsafe
10/08/2013 22:25 @FleetingMadness I think I'm moodiness or instability.
10/08/2013 22:23 @locuscoeruleus I never do anything with rhubarb but I am under the impression that it likes a strawberry
10/08/2013 22:22 @locuscoeruleus maybe throw in black pepper simple syrup? mix in a teeny bit of pepper with the salt? did you freeze/save any strawberries?
09/08/2013 18:26 I want school to happen or a break from my research pls
09/08/2013 18:25 oh yeah: work --&gt; $ --&gt; more sorbet
09/08/2013 18:25 but y go back to work tho
09/08/2013 18:11 the sorbet at cowhaus is some next-level shit
09/08/2013 18:09 @locuscoeruleus deep frying in olive oil sounds like a nightmare to me
09/08/2013 18:07 @bricksii jelly. I need to make vodka sauce again. sooo good.
09/08/2013 03:04 wow massively annoyed.
09/08/2013 02:52 @magnetochron cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats EVERYBODY

09/08/2013 02:48 ...and the pornographer's delight: .5 oz peach schnapps/1.5 oz goldschlager
09/08/2013 02:47 more shooters for Tay include the assblaster: 1oz apple schnapps/1oz lightning 101 or aftershock cinnamon
09/08/2013 02:39 @bricksii oh. we can name it something more pleasant.
09/08/2013 02:38 @bricksii I think it'd be alright, personally. it's okay if it curdles a little, but I don't think it will.
09/08/2013 02:37 @HuhRadio good call. quick and to the point.
09/08/2013 02:37 Tay said I should invent one called "anal sludge." done: 1oz jaegermeister, 1oz baileys.
09/08/2013 02:36 tasty and gets you FUCKED UP
09/08/2013 02:36 a shooter is characterized by: high proof, no carbonation, no ice, ~2oz volume
09/08/2013 02:35 like, the kind of cocktail. not anything else.
09/08/2013 02:35 I need to invent a new shooter.
09/08/2013 02:29 I'm glad I shotgunned that PBR. now I'm not hungry anymore.
09/08/2013 01:01 @zelukester good call &gt;:D
09/08/2013 01:01 @zelukester for real
08/08/2013 23:18 I don't own any yellow shoes :(
08/08/2013 21:58 because that's everything that I've ever wanted out of a cosmo
08/08/2013 21:58 http://t.co/V6WwrMXX9H :screams:
08/08/2013 21:30 @zelukester oh, shit! thanks for reminding me. :D
08/08/2013 17:54 yep okay http://t.co/Zpolq6TwCB
08/08/2013 17:46 I feel like I could do it on tumblr, and then I could guarantee my friends would read it. :D
08/08/2013 17:45 I should just start a blog to document all of the "lifestyle" type shit I do that is interesting.
08/08/2013 17:44 I should start a cocktail blog
08/08/2013 17:43 today is a day for bad hair, no makeup, and a lazy outfit. &gt;:(
08/08/2013 17:38 why am I not making falernum. why am I not making orgeat. why did I run out of alcohol to infuse. why
08/08/2013 17:35 goddamn it why am I not making my own tonic syrups right now
08/08/2013 17:34 it's that time of day where I have 567 tabs open from Serious Eats
08/08/2013 02:33 @maayanplaut how long has it been there? it'll still smell strong after 2 weeks, but the taste drastically mellows out. you'd be surprised.
07/08/2013 23:53 @zelukester rather than mix it with soda, I put it in my PBR &gt;:D
07/08/2013 23:53 @zelukester a shrub is something you drink with soda involving fruit, sugar, and vinegar. it is really sweet and tangy and tasty.
07/08/2013 23:53 @zelukester well, fruit, but not like, plants you don't eat
07/08/2013 23:50 I was skeptical about shrubs at first but now I am convinced
07/08/2013 23:50 shrub shandy
07/08/2013 19:57 just totally fucking bit the dust in 5" heels on Main St. YEP IT'S THAT KIND OF DAY

05/08/2013 14:48 @minjalinjee yeahhh...it's a long story. needless to say it's too late for me to say that I want to be called nif
04/08/2013 20:39 my problem is when I cd into /mnt I end up in the boot directory and not / which is where I want to be.
04/08/2013 20:37 in case you can help: I'm mounting a variety of different filesystems stored as qcow2 images. I'm running Debian Wheezy.
04/08/2013 20:34 Does anyone know anything about mounting disk images? I am frustrated and confused by newbie problems.
04/08/2013 20:22 I feel like I've gotten a billion new pairs of shoes lately
