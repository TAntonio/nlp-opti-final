06/12/2013 15:08 now someone (I know exactly the person) is going to keep emailing everyone gifs and it's all my fault.
06/12/2013 15:05 I just spilled fake coffee on myself after helping to circulate a department-wide email thread full of gifs. karma. figures.

05/12/2013 18:32 anyway, that happened at 6 this morning. I did eventually go back to sleep and had actual rest between 9 and 1.
05/12/2013 18:30 ...was trying to get to me. idk where I am, exactly. but I hear footsteps, door opening, and I have nowhere to go. I wake up.
05/12/2013 18:30 ...cornered in a bathroom stall. I hear loud footsteps and shouting in the hall. children performing a pageant were massacred b/c someone...
05/12/2013 18:29 ...to kill me. I use pathos to stop them, but everyone else is out to get me too. I have to run around and hide a whole lot until I get...
05/12/2013 18:29 Here's what happened: so I find out, somehow, that there's a million-dollar bounty on my head. a bunch of my friends from home are trying...
05/12/2013 18:27 Dream report: absolute action-adventure-thriller nightmare. hhhhohhhh my god. I never want to sleep again.
05/12/2013 03:58 @plaidplaidduck peel 1 panel of banana. scrape out some insides. fill with chocolate, pb, w/e, wrap in foil and roast over fire. eat w/spoon
05/12/2013 03:36 @plaidplaidduck I had the soda awhile ago, and also a caffeine pill. maybe I could make a banana boat and toast it on the stove.
05/12/2013 03:34 ...but Eric lost. :(
05/12/2013 03:33 This fighter on Salty Bet, "Eric," may actually be Eric Spoerl.
05/12/2013 03:16 I...I'm so done. I just don't feel like doing work anymore. Maybe if I take it easy tonight I can reset for tomorrow.
05/12/2013 01:29 @klaauser fuck teamwork

04/12/2013 21:29 totally passed tweet no. 6666 with no fanfare &gt;:(
04/12/2013 21:26 @klaauser ah yes good call
04/12/2013 20:05 I could...print them! or pipe them into a file! or something!
04/12/2013 20:05 :flops around wildly: I can retrieve my tweets using a python wrapper for the twitter API.
04/12/2013 18:10 ... or contribute to the project AT ALL
04/12/2013 18:10 REALLY annoyed by catty comments in the user testing from people in my HCI group. maybe you could show up to meetings once in a while ...
04/12/2013 18:02 @verticaltrout oh nooo umm I'm not home and I'm too far away/busy right now to go home. @theDickUpBear are you home?
04/12/2013 17:57 rosemary/olive oil potato chips + lemon soda :3
04/12/2013 16:36 @verticaltrout @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight generally someone is around starting at noon or so, if that works.
04/12/2013 14:56 "You seem to live in that lab!" I do, thanks for noticing, Bob Geitz. &gt;:D
04/12/2013 04:12 @verticaltrout @theDickUpBear @TheBardofNight Tay should be there? If not I will be there in 30.

03/12/2013 23:01 @orashaboogie I don't wanna talk to strangers I'd rather come see you :D
03/12/2013 23:00 @orashaboogie I need to reinstall Mac OSX but I don't have an install disk. also I need to back up my stuff before I do that.
03/12/2013 22:36 @orashaboogie when do you work at the help desk? I need help.
03/12/2013 17:44 I just never end up giving presents on the appropriate holiday. they almost always get deferred to new year's.
03/12/2013 17:43 now I suddenly have a billion ideas of what to get everyone for New Year's.
03/12/2013 17:43 I just remembered Scoutmob exists (it's a little like etsy, but with a limited number of sellers + lots of quality control + focus on local)
03/12/2013 16:32 @jwisser np, your help was appreciated. :)
03/12/2013 16:31 @jwisser hmmmm...okay, thanks!
03/12/2013 16:30 @jwisser ah okay. nah, I'm fine with that stuff. it just seems like things could get messy.
03/12/2013 16:29 @jwisser starting over w/ubuntu instead of snow leopard
03/12/2013 16:28 @jwisser but that is better advice than what I was planning.
03/12/2013 16:28 @jwisser okay. it's just that time is of the essence and I don't have my install CD with me. :&lt;
03/12/2013 05:56 @jwisser SMART is "verified."
03/12/2013 05:47 maybe that explains why I feel p down.
03/12/2013 05:47 seasonal...depression?
03/12/2013 05:35 @jwisser a little over 4 years old. Snow Leopard. reformatted and installed Snow Leopard again 2 years ago. HD.
03/12/2013 05:32 getting an awful lot of kernel panics lately, not sure what to do really. (paging @jwisser)
03/12/2013 05:32 I realize it's "precise" pangolin but I think pedantic is better.
03/12/2013 05:31 would kind of rather be using Ubuntu 12 (Pedantic Pangolin) anyway
03/12/2013 05:31 great. I ultra-broke my computer. considering just wiping everything and starting from scratch b/c I don't have my Mac OSX disk with me.
03/12/2013 02:17 @verticaltrout okay cool! Well I am going to my lab and then 4meal pretty soon but @theDickUpBear should be home.
03/12/2013 02:04 @verticaltrout yeah we're in our house! knock on door. you'll have to park someone in b/c I don't think there's room for a 4th car next door
03/12/2013 01:19 now I'm sitting in bed and eating any combination of garlic parmesan pretzel chips, potato chips, and spicy hummus.
03/12/2013 01:07 well I curled up in bed with the intention of doing...something. I'm not sure what I was thinking. I'm definitely doing nothing.
03/12/2013 00:10 I finally did my dishes. :)
sad
02/12/2013 23:07 @FleetingMadness you caught me. That one is my magnum opus.
02/12/2013 21:48 @verticaltrout I would be there but I am too broke to go out. Sorry! ;~;
02/12/2013 20:13 I am in No Mood for anything
02/12/2013 20:03 stop bothering me with emails about this party I'm not going to attend. you have one literally every month at least and I never go.

02/12/2013 18:49 @yak_dad @JamieisPerf @nautilimeyer as a rule, I don't really give rides anymore. :\ let me know if you absolutely can't find anyone, though
02/12/2013 05:49 @blaiddxdrwg aaaaAAAAAA
02/12/2013 05:31 @jwisser I remember the terror that a BSOD instilled in me as a child. it is so cold and scary and urgent. it freaked me the fuck out.
02/12/2013 05:30 @jwisser that screen was so weird and scary! I did not like it.
02/12/2013 05:30 I feel like usually when there's a kernel panic it just shuts itself down and makes me deal with it.
02/12/2013 05:29 KERNEL PANIC?! that was really weird. my mac just straight-up told me to shut it down. it's never done that before.
02/12/2013 04:19 I'm short enough that people think I'm liftable. what if there's a ceiling fan?
02/12/2013 04:17 things I worry about: someone picking me up and lifting me into a ceiling fan.

01/12/2013 22:20 @aDoctorMoon oh noooo I'm glad I didn't read the whole thing it just looked so horrible I had to stop
01/12/2013 21:08 my grade in HCI is miraculously still ~96%, higher than the average and the median. &gt;:D
01/12/2013 20:49 looks like touhou anyway
01/12/2013 20:49 I'm glad I didn't bet. what would I even do? I would have bet the one that can switch out, but she seems like she's not switching in time.
01/12/2013 20:48 d-double touhou on saltybet????
01/12/2013 20:09 it was just one of those things where I was like "you actually buy into this shit?...I...I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
01/12/2013 20:09 at least, I think it was. it was too difficult to get through so I skimmed it.
01/12/2013 20:08 wow. I just saw, like, the worst, most fat-negative article in ever. posted on fb by someone I know at Oberlin. really?!

29/11/2013 18:39 it's not really that bad, I'm exaggerating a little. but I do not feel so great.
29/11/2013 18:38 is this (crippling vertigo and dizziness accompanied by nausea) going to be for forever ??

25/11/2013 21:52 Meg brought her cat to hci today and I gotta say that definitely made my day better. :)
25/11/2013 21:52 Watch fourteen 20-somethings try to keep their shit together when a cat comes to class.
25/11/2013 20:22 I pity whoever sits next to me in HCI today. probably Cynthia.
25/11/2013 20:22 I smell awful because I forgot to put on deodorant today. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 20:21 ...this account is private, right? O___O"""""
25/11/2013 20:20 they said they'd get back to me in 2-3 weeks. I guess that'll give me enough time to detox.
25/11/2013 20:19 but also during job interview: "of course we'd have to drug test/background check you" O__O"
25/11/2013 20:19 I have been joking that I am minus a cat but up $5000, so I can get as many new cats as I want. or one cat + vet bills.
25/11/2013 20:18 I just had a job interview, also! for an entry-level position that I might be getting into after my internship is over! today is not so bad.
25/11/2013 19:59 ":raises eyebrow: Mozilla, huh?" YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.
25/11/2013 19:32 @TheBardofNight yeah! Seems good.
25/11/2013 19:26 @TheBardofNight yes, yes I do.

25/11/2013 18:37 @vomeronasal sure, feel free to bring him by my lab anytime before 3 (if you have time), if not we could meet for coffee later or w/e works
25/11/2013 18:22 @donnerhai not saying you're wrong or anything, just something to consider.
25/11/2013 18:22 @donnerhai sure but it's anyone's own business what their level of treatment is. you can choose for yourself until legality becomes an issue
25/11/2013 18:03 rant over, I promise. time to get back to work.
25/11/2013 18:03 and making people like me out to be wholly subservient to big pharma is not cool at all.
25/11/2013 18:02 I'm not saying that it's not okay to be off meds. it's excellent if you can do that, it probably feels great. but it doesn't work for all.
25/11/2013 18:01 it's hell of sensationalist too &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:59 feels like, even after yesterday, we have a lot of work to do. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:59 also from skimming this horrible website I can tell these assholes are spreading misunderstanding about mental health which totally donks
25/11/2013 17:58 like, if you can get by without meds, great. I can't, and that is NOT a comment on my character. so fUCK YOU
25/11/2013 17:58 found an outrageous website full of outrageous people yelling about how bad psych meds are. &gt;:\
25/11/2013 17:48 @hey_yes_wat uh
25/11/2013 15:43 @FleetingMadness that's very sweet of you! I might take you up on that if I have time. that would be very, very nice indeed.
25/11/2013 15:42 I gotta say if I don't get the internship I worked so hard for, today will most certainly be the worst day ever.
25/11/2013 15:41 @FleetingMadness so, you know. :') thanks
25/11/2013 15:40 @FleetingMadness I will be okay thanks for asking. it's a sad day but I understand that it had to happen. and I got to see a video of my cat
25/11/2013 15:23 @horrorwine yesssss so cute
25/11/2013 15:17 thanks everyone for being so sweet I know I've been going on about my cat forever now but ya know. I am very sad.
25/11/2013 15:16 @horrorwine cute things would be great. :') thanks for asking.

24/11/2013 00:42 .@jwisser 4tbsp flour, sugar, 2tbsp cocoa pwdr, oil, milk. If it doesn't look like cake batter, add 1 egg. Microwave 1 min.
24/11/2013 00:19 or maybe it's not, but I'm holding a grudge and blaming everyone
24/11/2013 00:19 it's some ~real food~ bullshit, let me tell you, that compels otherwise lovely people to condemn me for eating cAKE
24/11/2013 00:18 because it's INSTANT CAKE
24/11/2013 00:17 people would be lining up to ask me the recipe. Seriously.
24/11/2013 00:17 I caught a lot of shit from my friends in Harkness (!!!) for eating mug cake. I feel like on Hall that shit wouldn't fly and ...
24/11/2013 00:17 okay this is bullshit someone who used to give me so much shit for eating mug cake favorited someone's fb status about mug cake.

22/11/2013 16:44 @plaidplaidduck only if I can be in the band.
22/11/2013 16:42 did I say inner peace? I meant "barely-controlled agitation."
22/11/2013 16:42 people talking loudly outside my lab are destroying my inner peace.
